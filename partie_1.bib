  abstract = {This paper presents a framework for how the multifaceted nature of ``gender'' (human and linguistic)~interacts with grammatical operations such as coreference dependency formation. It frames the question through the lens of English, in which it focuses on how personal names and referents who identify as nonbinary can provide insight into the conceptual representations~of gender. Additional data from a variety of modern languages supports a model of how gender~might be cognitively represented such that the observed linguistic patterns are available. I propose~a three-tiered model of gender that unites grammatical, cognitive, social, and biological aspects and describes how implications of this model might be tested in future work.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a strong set of results for resolving gendered ambiguous pronouns on the Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns shared task. The model presented here draws upon the strengths of state-of-the-art language and coreference resolution models, and introduces a novel evidence-based deep learning architecture. Injecting evidence from the coreference models compliments the base architecture, and analysis shows that the model is not hindered by their weaknesses, specifically gender bias. The modularity and simplicity of the architecture make it very easy to extend for further improvement and applicable to other NLP problems. Evaluation on GAP test data results in a state-of-the-art performance at 92.5\% F1 (gender bias of 0.97), edging closer to the human performance of 96.6\%. The end-to-end solution presented here placed 1st in the Kaggle competition, winning by a significant lead. The code is available at https://github.com/sattree/gap.},

  abstract = {Gender-neutral pronouns are increasingly being introduced across Western languages. Recent evaluations have however demonstrated that English NLP systems are unable to correctly process gender-neutral pronouns, with the risk of erasing and misgendering non-binary individuals. This paper examines a Dutch coreference resolution system's performance on gender-neutral pronouns, specifically hen and die. In Dutch, these pronouns were only introduced in 2016, compared to the longstanding existence of singular they in English. We additionally compare two debiasing techniques for coreference resolution systems in non-binary contexts: Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) and delexicalisation. Moreover, because pronoun performance can be hard to interpret from a general evaluation metric like LEA, we introduce an innovative evaluation metric, the pronoun score, which directly represents the portion of correctly processed pronouns. Our results reveal diminished performance on gender-neutral pronouns compared to gendered counterparts. Nevertheless, although delexicalisation fails to yield improvements, CDA substantially reduces the performance gap between gendered and gender-neutral pronouns. We further show that CDA remains effective in low-resource settings, in which a limited set of debiasing documents is used. This efficacy extends to previously unseen neopronouns, which are currently infrequently used but may gain popularity in the future, underscoring the viability of effective debiasing with minimal resources and low computational costs.},

  abstract = {If there is such a thing as essential reading in metaphysics or in philosophy of language, this is it. Ever since the publication of its original version, Naming and Necessity has had great and increasing influence. It redirected philosophical attention to neglected questions of natural and metaphysical necessity and to the connections between these and theories of reference, in particular of naming, and of identity. From a critique of the dominant tendency to assimilate names to descriptions and more generally to treat their reference as a function of their Fregean sense, surprisingly deep and widespread consequences may be drawn. The largely discredited distinction between accidental and essential properties, both of individual things (including people) and of kinds of things, is revived. So is a consequent view of science as what seeks out the essences of natural kinds. Traditional objections to such views are dealt with by sharpening distinctions between epistemic and metaphysical necessity; in particular by the startling admission of necessary a posteriori truths. From these, in particular from identity statements using rigid designators whether of things or of kinds, further remarkable consequences are drawn for the natures of things, of people, and of kinds; strong objections follow, for example to identity versions of materialism as a theory of the mind. This seminal work, to which today's thriving essentialist metaphysics largely owes its impetus, is here published with a substantial new Preface by the author.},

  abstract = {We study the potential synergy between two different NLP tasks, both confronting predicate lexical variability: identifying predicate paraphrases, and event coreference resolution. First, we used annotations from an event coreference dataset as distant supervision to re-score heuristically-extracted predicate paraphrases. The new scoring gained more than 18 points in average precision upon their ranking by the original scoring method. Then, we used the same re-ranking features as additional inputs to a state-of-the-art event coreference resolution model, which yielded modest but consistent improvements to the model's performance. The results suggest a promising direction to leverage data and models for each of the tasks to the benefit of the other.},

  abstract = {Although syntactic information is beneficial for many NLP tasks, combining it with contextual information between words to solve the coreference resolution problem needs to be further explored. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end parser that combines pre-trained BERT with a Syntactic Relation Graph Attention Network (RGAT) to take a deeper look into the role of syntactic dependency information for the coreference resolution task. In particular, the RGAT model is first proposed, then used to understand the syntactic dependency graph and learn better task-specific syntactic embeddings. An integrated architecture incorporating BERT embeddings and syntactic embeddings is constructed to generate blending representations for the downstream task. Our experiments on a public Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns (GAP) dataset show that with the supervision learning of the syntactic dependency graph and without fine-tuning the entire BERT, we increased the F1-score of the previous best model (RGCN-with-BERT) from 80.3\% to 82.5\%, compared to the F1-score by single BERT embeddings from 78.5\% to 82.5\%. Experimental results on another public dataset - OntoNotes 5.0 demonstrate that the performance of the model is also improved by incorporating syntactic dependency information learned from RGAT.},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent work on trans and intersex history in the European Middle Ages, locating it within the established historiography on medieval gender and sexuality. It begins by surveying the three overarching themes in prior historical research on medieval gender and sexuality: identity, community and repression. Then, it introduces the context of the transgender turn in medieval studies, beginning in the late 2010s, by charting the origin of this sub-field and its rapid growth since 2020. It then outlines three key theoretical concepts underpinning its methodology: 1) gender is socially constructed and historically contingent; 2) likewise, biological sex is socially constructed and historically contingent; 3) all societies include people who transition away from their assigned gender, and, while these identities are no less contingent, they nevertheless constitute a valid subject for long histories of transness. Lastly, it argues that medieval trans and intersex studies contributes new perspectives and methodological approaches to each of the overarching research themes: 1) the lives and experiences of queer historical subjects such as Eleanor Rykener and Joseph of Sch{\"o}nau can be productively read through a trans lens, and trans historians' focus on questions of agency and subjectivity provides a model for exploring queerness in the medieval archive; 2) trans historians' arguments around community and mutual aid within trans case-studies revive the otherwise neglected historiographical topic of medieval queer networks; 3) trans historians demonstrate that medieval discourses around sexuality, gender and race are mutually constitutive, and significantly shape subsequent early modern European interactions with Black and indigenous societies.},

However many aspects of the OntoNotes annotation scheme are not well understood by NLP practitioners, including the treatment of generic NPs, noun modifiers, indefinite anaphora, predication and more. These often lead to counterintuitive claims, results and system behaviors. This opinion piece aims to highlight some of the problems with the OntoNotes rendition of coreference, and to propose a way forward relying on three principles: 1. a focus on semantics, not morphosyntax; 2. cross-linguistic generalizability; and 3. a separation of identity and scope, which can resolve old problems involving temporal and modal domain consistency.},
