<p>References to the <em>bos</em> in <em>Silence</em> mark the wilderness as beyond the patriarchal heteronormativity represented by Ebain. Posited as a fantasized site of escape from the court, where gender is fluid and trans identities sustainable, the wilderness reveals gender’s contextual dependence upon social systems, undermining their normative force.</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he story of a girl who is raised as a boy so that she can inherit her parents’ property—and who chooses to remain a boy for the social benefits that come with maleness<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1" class="rid-fn-text">1</a></sup>—Heldris de Cornouälle’s thirteenth-century <em>Roman de Silence</em> explicitly disrupts gender normativity and challenges gender essentialism. As a boy, Silence turns out to be the best possible knight, despite his biologically female body; he is also the best <em>jongleur</em>, and he would be the best-looking girl, if he followed his ‘nature’ and assumed a feminine identity.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text">2</a></sup> Throughout the romance, Nature and Nurture play prominent roles in determining Silence’s identity, arguing over their respective rights to his body. Not surprisingly, considerable critical attention has been paid to the debate between Nature and Nurture and whether its outcome—when Silence is exposed as biologically female and made to marry King Ebain— means a return to gender essentialism or issues a proto-feminist challenge to the established order.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text">3</a></sup> Many of these approaches, however, ignore the fact that both Nature and Nurture, as understood in <em>Silence</em>, are grounded in the patriarchal system of the post-Conquest court.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text">4</a></sup> As I argue in this article, it is only in the asocial space of the wilderness that the romance’s characters can imagine lives away from the restrictive systems of patrilineal reproduction and inheritance that govern gendered behavior and sexuality.</p>
<p>I argue in this essay that neither Nature nor Nurture in fact enables an escape from heteronormativity in the <em>Roman de Silence</em>. Instead, <em>Silence</em> directs our attention to how both forces operate within the patrilineal, patriarchal order by positing the <em>bos</em>—the forest or wilderness—as the largely fantasized realm of escape from this order. Seeking to negotiate gender within the binary that Nature and Nurture both embody does not enable an escape from established gender roles—even when that binary includes the appearance of <strong> [End Page 3] </strong> liberation offered by Nurture. <em>Silence</em> ultimately theorizes the intimate relation between gender and heteronormativity by demonstrating that an escape from binary formulations of gender is only possible where heterosexual (and patriarchally governed) reproduction ceases to be compulsory. The ‘where’ here is meant literally: it is only outside of the space of the patriarchal court system that the characters in <em>Silence</em> can see themselves as free to choose their identities, their mates, and their futures.</p>
<p>In a modern context, the spaces of heteronormativity have been investigated by literary critics Michael Warner and Lauren Berlant, and their approach usefully frames my project. Warner and Berlant consider how public spaces— what I am calling, in the context of <em>Silence</em>, simply ‘society’—participate in the regulation of gendered behavior and identity. Warner and Berlant’s research concerns New York zoning laws and heterosexual culture’s rhetorical regulation of sex to the domain of intimacy and privacy; their work exposes the public nature of sexuality and the extent to which heteronormative practices shape modern culture. Something similar, I argue, is happening in the world of <em>Silence</em>. Warner and Berlant argue that ‘Heteronormativity is more than ideology, or prejudice, or phobia against gays and lesbians; it is produced in almost every aspect of the forms and arrangements of social life: nationally, the state, and the law; commerce; medicine; education; plus the conventions and affects of narrativity, romance, and other protected spaces of culture.’<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5" class="rid-fn-text">5</a></sup> The social world engineered by <em>Silence</em>’s King Ebain is likewise governed by a heteronormative system of patrilineal reproduction; indeed, as literary scholars Sharon Kinoshita and Susan Crane have shown, romance as a genre can be seen to promote the interests of baronial lineage and ownership.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6" class="rid-fn-text">6</a></sup> Thus, <em>Silence</em>’s exploration of the <em>bos</em> as an imagined site of escape from Ebain’s patriarchal order suggests Warner and Berlant’s ‘changed possibilities of identity, intelligibility, publics, culture, and sex that appear when the heterosexual couple [or patrilineal court structure] is no longer the referent or privileged example of sexual culture.’<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7" class="rid-fn-text">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In <em>Le Roman de Silence</em>, the <em>bos</em> is the locus of such ‘changed possibilities,’ and the romance’s refusal to be categorized easily as either pro- or anti- gender fluidity suggests that a rigid adherence to cisgender identities is a product and tool of patrilineal systems of inheritance and governance. While <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> does not take an overt stance on transgender identities, it does decouple any essential link between biological sex and gender performativity. It is not prescriptive of gendered behavior; both male and female attributes are presented as equally possible for the very gifted Silence, and Heldris’ use of both masculine and feminine pronouns for this hero/ine positions Heldris as rhetorically open to Silence’s trans identity. What the romance reveals about gender is its contextual dependence upon a particular social system. This dependence can be seen most clearly in how the <em>bos</em> is repeatedly staged <strong> [End Page 4] </strong>as a place where Ebain’s restrictions regarding inheritance and reproduction do not apply. Silence’s masculine identity is a problem to the extent that his sexual and reproductive potential is invoked in Ebain’s court.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8" class="rid-fn-text">8</a></sup> But in the forest, Ebain’s grip on matters of inheritance, reproduction, and sexuality is lost.</p>

<h2 class="sec-headA"><small class="caps">ebain and the wilderness</small></h2>
<p>The <em>bos</em>, in <em>Silence</em>, is a realm where human law does not apply. For this reason, I translate <em>bos</em> more often as ‘wilderness’ than simply as ‘forest’; while the <em>bos</em> is not exclusively a wild space, I wish to emphasize its placement beyond human law and control, which is crucial to its function in the romance. Writing about medieval romance, Gillian Rudd differentiates between the ‘wilderness’ and the ‘forest’; the latter, she argues, is a sort of liminal space between human civilization and its other, a place where the wanderer usually happens upon another person, a castle, or at least a pavilion. The wilderness offers no such promise of human company.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9" class="rid-fn-text">9</a></sup> In <em>Silence</em>, the <em>bos</em> encapsulates both of these regions: some meaningful encounters occur there—Silence meets Merlin (in both his helpful and Wild Man guises) and the <em>jongleurs</em> locate a castle—but the <em>bos</em> is also invoked as a space of radical otherness, one that lies outside of organized human society. Rudd describes the wilderness as a place that is ‘wild, in that it is uncultivated land, and also [in that it] contains wildness . . . These two together combine to make it a geographical and cultural area that is utterly different from human space.’<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10" class="rid-fn-text">10</a></sup> The wilderness is outside of human law and convention; it ‘refuses to recognise those aspects by which we customarily seek to differentiate ourselves from [the] rest of the world,’ such as the upholding of codes of conduct.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11" class="rid-fn-text">11</a></sup> In this way, it becomes a refuge for ‘humans who wish to escape human society.’<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12" class="rid-fn-text">12</a></sup> Corinne Saunders sees forests, which she does not explicitly distinguish from the wilderness, as ‘specialized worlds of marvel, peril and delight, characterized by speaking stags, exotic pavilions, idyllic glades and boiling springs’; at the same time they are linked to the real forests of the human world, the places of ‘the hunt, the herdsmen, the assarts and fortified castles.’<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13" class="rid-fn-text">13</a></sup> The forest, Saunders suggests, is at once fantasized and real<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14" class="rid-fn-text">14</a></sup>—an idea that is particularly pertinent to <em>Silence</em> and that I take up in more detail below. For now, the essential point is that the <em>bos</em> is posited as a place of escape from human society—which, in this text, is largely identified with the controlling influence of King Ebain.</p>
<p>Ebain is emblematic of patrilineal inheritance and patriarchal institutions in the romance. It is he who disenfranchises women in an effort to curb the violence of his barons (ll. 314–18);<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15" class="rid-fn-text">15</a></sup> he who eagerly marries Eufemie, taking her like a possession, along with ‘many black horses . . . and bears and fowlers and lions’ [Cil prendent la fille al Norois / Et maint cheval avoec morois, / Et ors et ostoirs et lyons,] (ll. 231–33) in order to end the war between England and Norway (ll. 173–90);<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16" class="rid-fn-text">16</a></sup> he who tries to orchestrate the marriage between <strong> [End Page 5] </strong> Cador and Eufemie that will result in Cador’s inheriting Cornwall;<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17" class="rid-fn-text">17</a></sup> and he who eventually exposes Silence’s naked body and marries her (ll. 6572–74, 6677). Ebain controls marriage and inheritance, and in doing so privileges a patriarchal (and frequently self-serving) order. This order is pervasive; even Silence’s stint in the French court ends when he is called back by Ebain. Finally, it is at Ebain’s command that Silence is re-gendered as female and made to marry the king and give over to him the property which she can now by his decree inherit, and presumably go on to bear his heirs.</p>
<p>In the wilderness of the <em>bos</em>, however, Ebain’s power dissipates. The first sign of this dissipation is the early episode of the dragon, whose death at Cador’s hands precipitates the rest of the romance’s action. The dragon attacks as Ebain and his men ‘were passing through the woods’ [qu’il passent par le bos] (l. 345) on their way to Winchester, and they are completely incapable of protecting themselves. ‘Not one of them will be able to escape,’ the narrator tells us. ‘King Evan was greatly disconcerted’ [N’i a un qui estordre en pue . . . L[i] roi Ebayns fort s’esmarist] (ll. 354 and 356). The dragon kills thirty of his men, ‘And King Evan wept and lamented,’ later asking, ‘What shall we do?’ [Et li rois Ebayns plaint et plore . . . ‘Quel le feron?’] (ll. 372 and 375). Without diminishing the very real danger that such a dragon would, I presume, represent, Ebain’s paralysis is striking.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18" class="rid-fn-text">18</a></sup> As soon as he steps into the <em>bos</em>, he finds himself powerless. There seems to be no way out of this bind until he decides to reward the killer of the dragon with the woman of his choice—another recourse to the patriarchal trade in women that seems to be his go-to governing strategy.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19" class="rid-fn-text">19</a></sup> We are later told that these woods are called ‘el bos de Malroi’ (l. 559), a name suggestive of his poor judgment: he is, in fact, a bad king.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20" class="rid-fn-text">20</a></sup> Moreover, the ‘Forest of the Bad King’ brings bad things to the king; his power is virtually lost there, retained only in his homosocial control over his knights, to whom he can promise wealth and women. Because Ebain is associated with patrilineal inheritance structures and a strict patriarchal order, his loss of control suggests the possibility of eluding the systems that determine his subjects’ reproductive and gender identities.</p>
<p>The dragon episode is a particularly striking example of Ebain’s inability to act in the <em>bos</em>, but it is not the only one. When Eufemie and Cador are waiting to hear whether they will be allowed to marry, Eufemie tells her beloved that, if the king betrays his promise, she would be willing to flee with Cador to the ‘bos’ or the ‘lande’ (‘forest or field,’ l. 1361), indicating that this zone is beyond Ebain’s reach.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21" class="rid-fn-text">21</a></sup> Merlin, as a wild, untrappable man who ultimately unmasks Ebain’s queen and continually eludes the king’s control, lives in the <em>bos</em> (l. 6003). Silence’s masculine identity is shaped in the remote manor where he grows up playing outside, riding through ‘woods and streams’ [en bos et en rivieres] (l. 2471). Finally, in his most acute crisis regarding his gender, Silence flees into the wilderness to pursue a life with the itinerant <em>jongleurs</em>, whose <strong> [End Page 6] </strong> presence at any court is always temporary and transient, enabling them to evade conscription into any particular social system.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22" class="rid-fn-text">22</a></sup> It is not insignificant that Silence uses the pretext of going ‘off to the forest to hunt’ [g’irai el bois berser] (l. 2881) when he sneaks off to join the <em>jongleurs</em>, and that the <em>jongleurs</em> themselves emerge from the same <em>bos</em>.</p>
<p>That the wilderness of the <em>bos</em> lies outside of the domain of patriarchal heteronormativity is even suggested by Eufemie. Eufemie, who acts both within the bonds of patriarchy (through her passive role in her marriage to Ebain) and outside of them (through her apparently prodigious infidelity) sees the <em>bos</em> as beyond heteronormative sexuality. When Silence refuses to sleep with her, citing the fact that to do so would be a sin, Eufemie snaps, ‘It’s much better to romp in here / than to let your body go to waste in some forest!’ [‘Ichi fait mellor arester / Q’en bos por son cors afoler,’] (ll. 3820–21). Eufemie is referring to her mocking charge that Silence’s concern over religious morality means that he must want to be an ‘hermites’ (l. 3813) or an ‘abé’ (l. 3815); however, it also clearly establishes the <em>bos</em> as a place where Silence would be free from the demands of heterosexuality—indeed, of sexuality full stop. Silence’s body could simply ‘go to waste’ there, rather than being conscripted into the Queen’s presumably heterosexual affair, or, later, into marriage to the King.</p>
<p><em>Afoler</em>, it should be noted—the verb translated above as ‘go to waste’— has several meanings in Old French, and these different meanings add to the irony of Eufemie’s charge. The primary meaning is to harm, injure, or waste; this is what Eufemie seems to mean when she tells Silence that he might as well squander his body in the <em>bos</em>. However, it can also mean to fool or deceive—which is what Silence is actually doing; or to drive one body mad—what the wilderness frequently does in romance; or, finally, to seduce—what Eufemie herself is trying to do. It can also mean ‘to cause to behave foolishly,’ which is how Heldris uses it when he refers to the French king’s behavior in kissing Silence.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23" class="rid-fn-text">23</a></sup> While the primary definition of ‘harm’ or ‘waste’ is clearly what is meant by Eufemie, the multivalence of this term suggests that the <em>bos</em> could also be a place where bodies engage in deception, if not seduction. In any case, Eufemie here seems to point to the route that would be most beneficial to Silence: simply leaving behind the whole nexus of questions regarding inheritance, marriage, and procreation. But, as I will demonstrate, the wilderness is not so simple, and when Eufemie literally does send Silence out into it, it does not provide such solace.</p>
</div>
<div class="sec">
<h2 class="sec-headA"><small class="caps">the ‘natural’ order</small></h2>
<p>In <em>Silence</em>, the wilderness is not associated with Nature. Unlike Romantic, post-Romantic, and ecocritical conceptions of the Natural, Heldris’ Nature is overwhelmingly on the side of the social world—including the patriarchal <strong> [End Page 7] </strong> order. Designating humans as ‘naturally’ opposed to wild animals, Nature sees them as followers of social convention, residents of houses, and eaters of cooked food.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24" class="rid-fn-text">24</a></sup> This distinction is most powerfully made by Merlin-the-Wild-Man’s ‘unnatural’ diet of herbs and roots: having been ‘nurtured in the woods’ [noris en bos] (l. 6003), he is encouraged to leave cooked meat and return to his vegetarian foraging by Nurture, not Nature (ll. 6008–10).</p>
<p>Readings of the romance that center on its relative degree of feminism frequently focus on the Nature/Nurture dichotomy. If Heldris endorses Nature’s triumph, then the romance is anti-feminist; if not, then he is resisting gender prescriptivism. However, the binary between Nature and Nurture is not consistently sustained within the romance. If, instead, we consider Nature and Nurture as working together within the social world of the romance, with the wilderness standing outside of that world, a second binary emerges, between Society and Wilderness. This new binary exposes the artificiality of the first: Nature and Nurture may be opposed to each other in the details, but in the end they both participate in the patriarchal structure of Ebain’s rule, which curtails choices for women and consigns them to their reproductive functions.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25" class="rid-fn-text">25</a></sup> Nurture simply seeks to assign Silence a different role within that structure. Co-existing within the social order, Nature and Nurture’s conflict is essentially over what that order can include. The wilderness, on the other hand, remains the fantasized place of escape from patriarchal society—a place that, as the literary critic Robert Harrison puts it, is outside of history and thus perceived as more ‘real’ than society.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26" class="rid-fn-text">26</a></sup> Yet the wilderness of the <em>bos</em> is more often invoked than experienced or described in <em>Silence</em>, suggesting that it is a phantasmatic space of unexplored possibility. Thus, as I will propose in the final sections of this essay, even the binary between Society and Wilderness deconstructs in the end, and the hypothesized ‘outside’ of Ebain’s rule is virtually inaccessible as a geographical location. Nonetheless, it remains as a possibility, indicating that there is such an outside—and emphasizing the cultural, rather than ‘natural’ (in the modern sense), production of gendered performance.</p>
<p>If Nature had her way, Silence would live out her life within the confined, indoor spaces of the ladies’ quarters—a space that is starkly delineated against the more open spaces of male activity as well as against the <em>bos</em>. Silence comes into the sharpest conflict between his biological and assumed genders within the regulated, feminized social spaces of the sewing chamber, where he imagines himself as an inept woman, and Queen Eufemie’s chambers, where he is at greatest risk of exposing his inability to be sexually male. In these passages, what is ‘natural’ for women emerges as highly restrictive. When Silence, on the cusp of puberty, considers becoming female, he expresses his hesitation in terms of the confined space in which women reside: ‘[h]e began to consider / the pastimes of a woman’s chamber . . . / and weighed <strong> [End Page 8] </strong> in his heart of hearts / all female customs against his current way of life, / and saw, in short, that a man’s life / was much better than that of a woman’ [Donques li prent a sovenir / Des jus c’on siolt es cambres faire . . . / Et poise dont en son corage / Tolt l’us de feme a son usage, / Et voit que miols valt li us d’ome / Que l’us de feme] (ll. 2632–38). ‘Female customs’ are confined to the chamber—the space, incidentally, where we most often encounter Queen Eufemie. In the same passage, Silence associates femininity with sexual activity, rejecting it because ‘I have a mouth too hard for kisses, / and arms too rough for embraces’ [‘Trop dure boche ai por baisier, / Et trop rois bras por acoler,’] (ll. 2646–47), but also with an inability to engage in the free play that he has enjoyed as a boy, such as hunting with his bow and arrow or playing boys’ games (ll. 2559–66). Even Nature associates femaleness with the sewing chamber: ‘Go to a chamber and learn to sew!’ she scolds [‘Va en la cambre a la costure!’] (l. 2528). The women’s sphere is portrayed as both highly constricted and as ‘naturally’ indoors, and the victory of Nature at the end of the romance, literary critic Florence Jurney notes, is also the victory of patriarchal society.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27" class="rid-fn-text">27</a></sup> Women’s very movement is restricted within this ‘natural’ order, whereas what is ‘unnatural’ for women—military combat and boys’ games—is outdoors, wide-ranging, and physically free.</p>
<p>Yet the very dichotomy between ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ women’s spaces points to the constructed quality of the ‘natural.’ Both feminine and masculine spheres of activity are socially determined, with rules that assert who belongs where and what should be done there. Silence’s ability to cross the lines of gender performance demonstrates the artificiality of this dichotomy. It is ‘natural’ for men to be on the battlefield; therefore, as a man, Silence can— and does—meet with success there. Intriguingly, Heldris stresses Silence’s female sex in scenes of combat, while also underscoring his performance of masculinity. When Silence jousts in France, Heldris writes, ‘There never was a woman less reluctant / to engage in armed combat . . . / Whoever saw him jousting . . . / might well say that Nurture / can do a great deal to overcome Nature, / if she can teach such behavior / to a soft and tender woman’ [Ainc feme ne fu mains laniere / De contoier en tel maniere. / Kil veïst joster . . . / Dire peüst que Noreture / Puet moult ovrer contre Nature, / Quant ele aprent si et escole / A tel us feme et tendre et mole] (ll. 5147–56). The subsequent lines describe Silence in combat as ‘a tender, soft, faint-hearted woman’ [feme tendre, fainte et malle] (l. 5161) even as he easily bests his opponents. Silence is quite obviously <em>not</em> what Heldris here claims that he naturally is. At the same time, it is in battle that Silence is most explicitly recognized as a man: ‘A man like this,’ his French companions say, ‘inspires loyalty!’ [‘Tels hom,’ font il, ‘fait a amer,’] (l. 5553). There is irony in this line, to be sure, but at the same time, it is true: Silence is a great soldier and, in this respect at least, an ideal man.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28" class="rid-fn-text">28</a></sup> In scenes of combat, then, Heldris manages to emphasize <strong> [End Page 9] </strong> both Silence’s femininity <em>and</em> his successful masculinity, undermining the ‘unnaturalness’ of a woman’s martial success. What is ‘natural’ is more about perceived conformity to the scripts of human social expectations than about what a person can do; Silence, as a knight, superlatively conforms to the standards of military conduct expected of men, arguably living into his masculine ‘nature,’ even though that ‘nature’ is ‘nurtured.’ It is just as easy for him to follow Nurture as it presumably would be to follow Nature. With the exception of reproductive and sexual potential—which Silence’s encounters with Eufemie make clear is a problem—the romance suggests that there is no essential difference between male and female.</p>
<p>The fluidity of the boundaries between Nature and Nurture is suggested even more strongly by Nature’s association with art. Her work is highly artificial and crafted, and her construction of Silence is precisely that—a construction. In painstaking detail, Heldris describes how Nature forms the girl’s face and body, selecting the finest materials and her most beautiful, never-before-used facial mold (ll. 1871–1944). Erin Labbie sees these images of art as de-naturalizing Silence’s body, demonstrating that Silence lives ‘between the essence and the construct as well as between Nature and Nurture.’<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29" class="rid-fn-text">29</a></sup> From her conception, Silence’s position as Nature’s product is destabilized by the very language of creation that Heldris uses in connection with Nature. Importantly, Nature is not the only one who can mold a person, and Silence’s formation does not end with this initial creative act. First, Cador continues and revises Nature’s work, declaring, ‘I want to make a male of a female’ [‘Faire en voel malle de femiele,’] (l. 2041). In fact, as the literary critic Victoria Blud observes, Silence’s physical creation is ongoing throughout the romance. Not only does Cador continue it with the assistance of Nurture, but God also intervenes. When Silence prays in battle that God will strengthen what Nature ‘makes weak’ in him, Silence’s subsequent victory suggests that God has done so.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30" class="rid-fn-text">30</a></sup> Nature’s creative efforts, then, are ‘open to interpretation from others and even correction by God.’<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31" class="rid-fn-text">31</a></sup> These details throw the idea of Nature as a distinct conceptual category into question. While Nature is consistent in what she wants—for Silence to behave like a girl, for Merlin to behave like a civilized man—and despite the fact that Nature seems to ‘win’ at the conclusion of the romance, the association between her creative work and the creative work of humans, Nurture, and God makes it difficult to say what is distinct about her. Ultimately, as Danièle James-Raoul points out, the only domain in which Nature unambiguously rules is the domain of sexuality;<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32" class="rid-fn-text">32</a></sup> but Silence apparently lacks sexual desire, leaving open the possibility that he could evade this problem were it not for Eufemie.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33" class="rid-fn-text">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In other ways, too, the apparent binary between Nature and Nurture falls apart.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34" class="rid-fn-text">34</a></sup> Nature and Nurture agree, for instance, on the indelibility of social class,<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35" class="rid-fn-text">35</a></sup> and, as Kristin Burr points out, Heldris’ claims about how they <strong> [End Page 10] </strong> affect an individual’s character show them to be virtually interchangeable. Asserting, for example, not only that Nature determines character (ll. 1835–60) but that Nurture can overcome Nature in corrupting a person’s character (ll. 2296–2342) and can reshape a base Nature (ll. 5171–74), Heldris muddies the waters significantly, making it impossible to say what is distinct about each allegorical figure or who is likely to dominate in any given situation.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36" class="rid-fn-text">36</a></sup> When it comes to what determines character, the binary distinction between Nature and Nurture is all but useless;<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37" class="rid-fn-text">37</a></sup> ostensibly opposed to one another, they nonetheless work in almost precisely the same way.</p>
<p>Crucially, both also operate within the same essential system: the patriarchal and patrilineal culture that revolves around the production of male heirs. ‘Nature’ is the enabling force of patrilineal reproduction, which is supported by the gender binary that Nature seeks to enforce and the concomitant submission of women. Silence, in his transgender state, cannot produce an heir, either by fathering or by mothering one, and—while it is never overtly explored—this is a problem with his masculine identity. The fact that s/ he is married off immediately upon the exposure of her body at the end of the romance, becoming the potential mother of the king’s heirs, shows this problem’s importance. What is ‘natural’ is what enables patriarchal reproduction. Nurture, on the other hand, obstructs Silence’s reproductive capacity. But even in following Nurture and becoming a boy, Silence participates in the patrilineal system: he initially assumes this masculine identity in order to inherit in a world where women are disenfranchised. Silence and his parents may be bending the rules, but they are hardly subverting the system. While Nurture and Nature argue over the details, then, ultimately both are concerned with fitting Silence’s body into a system of strict male inheritance.</p>
<p>A patriarchal society, as Sarah Roche-Mahdi argues, ‘cannot tolerate gender bivalence,’<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38" class="rid-fn-text">38</a></sup> and the importance of patrilineal inheritance under Ebain’s governance shows this to be especially the case in <em>Silence</em>. Silence must be assigned to a stable, biologically supported gender in order for her reproductive potential—her most important asset in this system—to be fully exploited.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39" class="rid-fn-text">39</a></sup> Seeing reproduction as central to the romance’s concerns, Kinoshita argues that <em>Silence</em> ‘redefines the function of the medieval nobility as not military service but genealogical reproduction.’<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40" class="rid-fn-text">40</a></sup> Within this system, the woman’s primary duty is to produce male heirs. Even Ebain’s ‘gift’ of Cornwall to Eufemie and Cador stresses this duty; setting aside the fact that Eufemie would have inherited Cornwall in her own right had Ebain not made his decree against female inheritance, what Ebain initially frames as an outright gift is instead revealed to be contingent upon Eufemie’s having a son.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41" class="rid-fn-text">41</a></sup> Moreover, by insisting on Cador and Eufemie’s marriage, Kinoshita contends, Ebain ‘inscribes their union within the bounds of feudal politics,’<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42" class="rid-fn-text">42</a></sup> <strong> [End Page 11] </strong> rendering this fully consensual marriage politically significant and, at least rhetorically, controlled by the king. The romance thus reflects a change in high medieval feudal politics, Kinoshita argues, in which male nobles’ bodies became less important as warriors than as producers of heirs, and Silence’s recoding as a woman demonstrates the centrality of lineage and heredity to this society—of securing property not through war, but by maintaining a clear line of inheritance.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43" class="rid-fn-text">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Kinoshita’s argument is based on the assumption that <em>Silence</em> was composed in the later thirteenth century, a dating that has recently been revised to the first quarter of that century.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44" class="rid-fn-text">44</a></sup> Given the ongoing importance of lineage and inheritance for the securing of property in the Middle Ages, however, this change does not substantially challenge Kinoshita’s claim; <em>Silence</em>’s focus on heredity and property is equally applicable to an early thirteenth-century context.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45" class="rid-fn-text">45</a></sup> Female inheritance, for instance, was prevalent at both ends of the century. Almost a fifth of baronial estates were inherited by women between 1200 and 1327,<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46" class="rid-fn-text">46</a></sup> suggesting that Ebain’s initial decree eliminating female inheritance would have been of interest throughout this whole period. <em>Silence</em>’s attention to fickle and unstable rulers also would have been salient in the early part of the century; John’s rule in England, from 1199–1216, was memorialized shortly after his death as ‘less than successful’ and the king himself as ‘a despoiler of the inhabitants’ of his realm.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47" class="rid-fn-text">47</a></sup> Regardless of when in the thirteenth century the romance may have been composed, then, the problems of inheritance and land-grabbing kings would have figured into contemporary political anxieties.</p>
<p>Within this political setting, Silence’s feminization at the end of the romance underscores the importance of biological reproduction. By replacing the childless Eufemie with Silence, Ebain also reopens the possibility of siring an heir. Thus, the social world of the romance is emphatically, inescapably patriarchal, and Nurture continues to participate in this system even as she resists Nature. But the wilderness, as what is outside of Ebain’s control and thus of his social world, emerges as the counterweight to this patriarchal system, a place where characters can imagine themselves free from the restrictions imposed by both Nature <em>and</em> Nurture. In the wilderness, outside of the social system in which Nature and Nurture both act, the way in which the hero/ine performs his/her gender is posited as irrelevant. Attention to the role of the wilderness as a fantasized space of escape from Ebain’s rule suggests what we might anachronistically call a trans-positive reading of the text that stresses the arbitrariness of both ‘natural’ and ‘nurtured’ understandings of the gendered body.</p>
<p>But the wilderness’ role as a space of possibility for gender fluidity and bivalence does not lead to a utopian conclusion. The wilderness is not a place of permanent residence for humans,<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48" class="rid-fn-text">48</a></sup> and even if it were, this permanence <strong> [End Page 12] </strong> would come at the cost of social legibility. Only Merlin spends any significant time in the wilderness; while the <em>jongleurs</em> pass through it on their way from one court to another, they do not offer permanent respite for the romance’s hero/ine. The space outside of the heteronormative system is elusive, even illusory—yet it remains as a possibility, indicating that system’s ideological and practical limits.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Silence himself spends little time in the <em>bos</em>. Although Heldris tells us that Silence’s outdoor play effectively turns him into a boy, this play is within the social space of the romance; he is still affiliated with the seneschal’s home, presumably playing within its grounds. But Silence does leave this social world on two important occasions: first, to flee the seneschal’s court and join the <em>jongleurs</em>; and second, when he is sent on his mission to retrieve Merlin from the forest. In the first instance, the hero’s contact with the wilderness is fleeting. He does not rush off into the forest in order to live there, free of gender constraints; rather, he sees life with the <em>jongleurs</em> as enabling him to escape the bind of ill-fitting gender roles and to learn a craft that suits both men and women. This life of freedom is not in the unsocialized wilderness, but in art; geographically, it demands itinerancy, moving from one court to another without being bound to any. Requiring passage through the wilderness, the life of the <em>jongleur</em> is figured as outside of patriarchal society, if not society itself. And this comparative freedom is ruined, for Silence, by the <em>jongleurs</em>’ greed—the social vice against which Heldris rails repeatedly in his narrative asides, the vice with which he associates court life.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49" class="rid-fn-text">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Silence decides to become a <em>jongleur</em> because, while he prefers life as a male, he recognizes that this identity may be untenable in the long term (ll. 2825–72).<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50" class="rid-fn-text">50</a></sup> In becoming a <em>jongleur</em>, he reasons, he will acquire a skill that will benefit him even if his sex is unveiled later in life; thus he can remain a male without foreclosing the possibility of someday being female. He can, in effect, retain both genders. He can also pass in and out of courtly spaces at will, with the <em>bos</em> as the point of articulation between them: the <em>bos</em> is the liminal space from which the <em>jongleurs</em> emerge and to which they return, and the space through which Silence himself passes in order to become a <em>jongleur</em>. The <em>jongleurs</em> do not represent the <em>bos</em>, of course, and neither are they at home in it; in fact, when they first come to the seneschal’s home and meet Silence, they are fleeing the darkened forest in fear of being robbed there (ll. 2710–28). This passage is worth quoting at length for what it indicates about the forest’s significance and the <em>jongleurs</em>’ troubled relationship with it: <strong> [End Page 13] </strong></p>

<p class="continued">The forest harbors threats for the <em>jongleurs</em>, specifically to their property. They don’t know how to navigate it, especially in the fog, and the manor—which occupies a liminal position between the road and the threatening wilderness— is a welcome respite. The manor’s very liminality resonates, in fact, with the bivalence of Silence’s gender: at once male and female, s/he is at once at home in the court and the <em>bos</em>, raised on the cusp of the wilderness that beckons as a site of freedom from gender norms. When Silence goes into the <em>bos</em> to seek the <em>jongleurs</em>, he believes that he is fleeing these norms—but the <em>jongleurs</em> themselves, with their virulent greed and desire for status, are no escape from the strictures of court life, even if they do not concern themselves with Silence’s gender. Yet their association with the wilderness and Silence’s conviction that this path through the <em>bos</em> will result in his freedom from the hazards of both masculinity and femininity add to the sense that the <em>bos</em> is outside of a binary system of gender. The wilderness of the <em>bos</em> is here associated with <strong> [End Page 14] </strong> freedom from the need to make a choice about gender and from the pressures of patrilineal inheritance—for ironically, in leaving home, Silence consents to lose the very inheritance that motivated his transgender identity.</p>
<p>But while passage through the wilderness enables escape from a restrictively patriarchal social world, it is not where that escape is sustained—at least, not for Silence. Merlin is, instead, the character most strongly associated with the wilderness. Merlin has a prolonged stint in the <em>bos</em>, which, for him, represents a successful (if impermanent) rejection of Nature; moreover, there is evidence to suggest Merlin’s own gender bivalence, as literary critic Lorraine Kochanske Stock argues. Merlin’s indifference to the traditional masculine activities of ‘martial puissance, sexual virility, or potency’ and his engineering of his own capture—a feat that is only to be accomplished by a woman—indicate his position outside of a strict gender binary.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51" class="rid-fn-text">51</a></sup> Beyond the social world of the patriarchal court, perhaps there is room for gender fluidity. Merlin himself is certainly beyond Ebain’s rule; he is a rule unto himself.</p>
<p>For Silence, though, the <em>bos</em>’ function as a vehicle for escape, if not the site of escape itself, principally suggests its place in the romance’s imaginary, rather than positing it as a viable long-term option. As in Eufemie’s pledge to flee to the <em>bos</em> with Cador if Ebain were to rescind his promise to let her choose a mate, it is an imagined scene of escape, rather than—at least, within the action of the romance—an inhabitable place of actual freedom from patrilineal concerns. For in the end, the wilderness is coopted—ironically enough, by Merlin himself—back into the heteronormativity of the court, and it is via the wilderness that Silence’s biological sex is unmasked.</p>
<p>In medieval romance, the wilderness is often a dehumanizing space, as in Chrétien’s <em>Yvain</em>, or a place where heroes are tested and transformed, as in <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em>.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52" class="rid-fn-text">52</a></sup> But Heldris seems to play with these characteristics. Silence is tested in the wilderness when he is sent to trap Merlin; but it’s a strange kind of test, as Silence himself does virtually nothing to capture the prophet. Indeed, Merlin essentially catches himself, appearing as a helpful old man who tells Silence what to do, procures the necessary bait, and then reappears in his wild guise to be trapped—by, apparently, his own cleverness. Silence does little more than stand by while all of this happens. And the transformation that Silence undergoes as a result is simply her exposure as a woman; while it is a transformation in the sense that it is literally the first time since her birth that she has been identified as female, it is the outcome of nothing more than her biology, not of any particular experience or accomplishment on her part. If this is Silence’s heroic trial and transformation, it is oddly deconstructed: both are moments of passivity rather than activity and the end result is the loss of her knightly identity.</p>
<p>The wilderness as a site of dehumanization is closer to the mark, if to be ‘dehumanized’ is to abandon social convention. Certainly Merlin has <strong> [End Page 15] </strong> dehumanized himself in the <em>bos</em>, according to Heldris’ Nature/Nurture paradigm. But can the notion of dehumanization be applied to Silence? Since Silence is re-gendered as female following his experience in the wilderness, it might follow that his masculine identity is being framed as a kind of dehumanization. This link makes sense given the terms of the romance; being male, like being hairy and wild, is against Nature, running counter to accepted social behavior. But to call the masculine Silence ‘dehumanized’ is in every other sense too jarring to be sustained—after all, he represents the ideals of courtly refinement, artistic skill, and knighthood. Indeed, trying to track Silence’s de- or re-humanization exposes, again, the slipperiness of the Nature/Nurture divide: if what is counter to Nature is inhuman, and Silence is working against Nature, then ‘humanity’ loses some of its most admirable traits of courtesy, loyalty, intelligence, etc. It thus makes little sense to see Silence’s masculine identity—which, after all, he inhabits in civilization, as well as in the wilderness—as dehumanizing. Nevertheless, by having Silence’s unmasking occur as the result of his time in the wilderness, Heldris seems to be toying with the conventional association of the wilderness with the hero’s dehumanization, just as he uses the trope of trial and transformation ironically: instead of revealing something about his hero’s prowess, the trial in the wilderness reveals her anatomy, as though her biological sex were all that truly mattered.</p>
<p>By re-conscripting Silence into heteronormative patriarchy, this ironic usage of the generic expectations of the wilderness undermines the sense of the wilderness as truly ‘outside’ of social systems. It is clearly imagined as such an ‘outside’ within the romance, where the wilderness of the <em>bos</em> is portrayed as beyond Ebain’s rule, evading his decrees and hyper-patriarchal governance. Certainly Heldris’ characters speak as though this were the case; even Eufemie’s insult reveals an idea of the wilderness as a space outside of the pressures of heterosexuality, where chaste abbots and hermits might retire. And passing through the wilderness to become a <em>jongleur</em> enables Silence to temporarily escape the need to choose a gendered identity. In the imagination, at least, there is an Outside of Ebain’s system, and this Outside is associated with the uncultivated, unknown space of the wilderness.</p>
<p>But that wilderness is, precisely, unknown, and as such it cannot be fully represented within the romance. Moreover, Silence does not truly escape Ebain’s court even when he is seeking Merlin in the <em>bos</em>. He goes there on a mission from Ebain; he is still—and still sees himself as—subject to the king. Silence’s bringing his subjection to Ebain into the wilderness suggests that the wilderness can be infiltrated by the social; the binary is not, in fact, transposed onto geographical locations, but seems to exist in the imagination at least as much as in reality. Just as the courts visited by the <em>jongleurs</em> can be places where Silence escapes the social system of heteronormative reproduction, bringing <strong> [End Page 16] </strong> the ethos of the <em>bos</em> into society, so too the wilderness can be a place where Silence is ‘caught,’ leading to his return to the court and exposure as female. On the one hand, then, the romance posits that the wilderness is not a real respite for Silence; there is no sustainable ‘outside’ of the patriarchal system. On the other hand, however, <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> exposes this system <em>as</em> a system. It is not a ‘natural’ state in the sense of being inevitable and beyond human control; it is, rather, ‘natural’ as nature is conceived of culturally and socially.</p>
<p>Despite the differences between Heldris’ conception of Nature and modern understandings of nature as a category, the romance’s absorption of nurture into nature—or the labeling as ‘natural’ of a system that is clearly socially constructed—mirrors contemporary feminism’s tendency to collapse gender characteristics into the category of ‘culture’ at the expense of ‘nature.’ Mark Seltzer points out the consequences of this collapse, arguing that ‘the deconstruction of the traditional dichotomy of the natural and the cultural [has] indicated merely the elimination of the first term and the inflation of the second.’<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53" class="rid-fn-text">53</a></sup> Responding to this claim, ecocritical literary scholar Stacy Alaimo sees nature not as eliminated through this rhetorical move, but rather as ‘situate[d] . . . as a discursive vanishing frontier.’<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54" class="rid-fn-text">54</a></sup> Contemporary feminist discussions of what is natural and what is cultural often seek to de-essentialize gender, argues Alaimo, by insisting on its cultural construction. Nature thus becomes a sort of phantasm: ‘As long as nature is imagined as the outside of culture,’ Alaimo writes, ‘the advance of language pushes the frontier of “nature” further away.’ Nature is thus reduced to nothing more than ‘a discursive formation and [this conceptual move] denies the possibility that nature could intervene or affect cultural systems.’<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55" class="rid-fn-text">55</a></sup> Alaimo is not describing medieval romance, of course, but her claim can be usefully applied to Silence’s situation. Heldris’ setting up of Nature and Nurture as an oppositional binary that ultimately collapses into confusion erases not only Nature but even Nurture as a meaningful signifier. In <em>Le Roman de Silence</em>, the <em>bos</em> or wilderness steps in as the signifier of that which is outside of culture—as <em>real</em> nature, we might say. But, as Rudd argues of the wilderness in medieval romance, the wilderness is only described as that which it is not, and it functions only relative to the human and social concerns of the tales in which it appears.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56" class="rid-fn-text">56</a></sup> The wilderness is Alaimo’s ‘discursive vanishing frontier’: imagined, yearned for as an escape, but never, finally, capable of articulation.</p>
<p>Yet the repeated projection of the <em>bos</em> as a place where gender norms and patriarchal systems can be overcome indicates the unnaturalness (in the modern sense) of these norms and systems. <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> thus engages with the possibility that there is an Outside to heteronormative patriarchy, that transgender identities can be maintained, and that gender itself is distinct from personal identity—that it is, perhaps, nothing more <strong> [End Page 17] </strong> than a performance enforced by socially constructed ideas of the natural.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57" class="rid-fn-text">57</a></sup> The fluidity of gender and its relation to performance is reflected in Heldris’ use of gendered language and the naming of Silence, as numerous scholars have pointed out.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58" class="rid-fn-text">58</a></sup> I argue, here, that Heldris’ invocations of asocial space represent this fluidity and even the arbitrariness of gendered performance by explicitly aligning heteronormative performance with Ebain’s court. Using the <em>idea</em> of the wilderness, Heldris demonstrates the possibility of evading patriarchal social systems. Of course, as the romance’s ending shows, the wilderness itself does not become an escape from the social world. Indeed, just as the seeming binary between Nature and Nurture deconstructs in the romance, so too does the binary that I proposed between Society and Wilderness. But this does not mean that social norms are inevitable in the romance—neither are they ‘natural’ in the modern sense. Rather, Heldris’ tale points to the pervasiveness of patriarchal ideology, in particular its ability to penetrate—here, through Silence’s willing subjugation to the Merlin quest— even into the farthest outposts beyond the known world. And yet, in doing so, it holds out the possibility of something else. Exposing the instability at the edges of Ebain’s domain, <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> indicates the arbitrariness and even destructibility of the system that he embodies.</p>
</div>
<div class="sec">
<h2 class="sec-headA"><small class="caps">conclusion</small></h2>
<p>Elizabeth Waters argues that <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> finally questions ‘the whole binary system [of gender]. If we can see outside this system, we realize that the important questions are not about nature or environment shaping identity, but how gender oppression works—which in turn offers us a glimpse down [a] . . . third path’ that does not insist upon adherence to a strict set of gender-based behavioral rules.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59" class="rid-fn-text">59</a></sup> By exposing the mechanisms of oppression, the romance calls the whole system of patriarchal dominance into question. As I have argued, what is made visible in the romance is <em>where</em> gender oppression works: specifically, within the civilized domain of King Ebain’s highly patriarchal court and kingdom. Designating this space as the locus of patriarchal control allows the narrative to posit an alternative—a realm beyond restrictive gender binaries that exposes them as ultimately artificial. In this realm, the wilderness of the <em>bos</em>, Ebain’s rule does not prevail, and his subjects seem to be capable of evading conscription into the patrilineal system of reproduction. By escaping the court, moreover, the subject flees (or seeks to flee) gender essentialism, which is inescapably bound to and produced by patriarchal systems of governance. The ‘third path’ that Waters refers to, then, might involve physical dislocation: resistance to the actual space of the court.</p>
<p>To what extent can such postulated dislocations from gender-normative patriarchal systems be found in other medieval romances? The wilderness— as a space beyond the bounds of the patrilineal court system that demands <strong> [End Page 18] </strong> submission to prescriptive gender identities—may be a place where gender roles are posited as fluid, and exploring this fluidity could be productive for scholars seeking to explore transgender potential or patriarchal resistance in medieval romance. While I am aware of no other romance that explores transgender identities as fully as <em>Silence</em>, there are a number of cases in which the dichotomous relationship between court and wilderness maps onto such possibilities—where the wilderness allows characters to act beyond the bounds of heteronormativity. In Marie de France’s twelfth-century lay <em>Lanval</em>, for instance, gender roles are reversed away from Arthur’s court, with the female lover controlling the terms of her sexual relationship with the lay’s eponymous hero. Likewise, Marie’s <em>Bisclavret</em> posits the wilderness as the site of a human-animal transformation that ultimately leads to the werewolf’s move away from a heterosexual marriage to an intense homosocial—even homoerotic—relationship with his king.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60" class="rid-fn-text">60</a></sup> Whereas the wilderness in <em>Lanval</em> creates a respite and escape from Arthur’s rule, in <em>Bisclavret</em> it is a place where perceived binaries—between human and animal, male and female, hetero- and homosexual—are overturned. In Chrétien de Troyes’ roughly contemporary <em>Yvain</em>, the wilderness is where Yvain is psychologically re-constituted away from both heterosexual marriage and the homosocial world represented by Gawain. In the fourteenth century, the Middle English <em>Sir Orfeo</em> engages with the wilderness as both a place of escape and a liminal space between this world and the world of fairy. The wilderness ultimately leads Orfeo back to his wife and to the restoration of his rights as king, but the ten-year period that he voluntarily spends in the forest is a means of escaping the pain that comes with the forced end of a heterosexual marriage (ll. 227–66).<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61" class="rid-fn-text">61</a></sup> While gender fluidity is not really at issue in the romance, the wilderness is implicitly posited as outside of his marriage and governance. Finally, in <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em>, Gawain’s sexual potency is repeatedly challenged by Lady Bertilak, raising questions about his role in heterosexual courtship and suggesting another possibility for mapping gender roles onto geographical space.</p>
<p>None of these examples precisely follows the model that I have set out here, of course; neither do they follow any one particular pattern. Yet they suggest that the wilderness—in addition to serving as a place of transformation and challenge for the romance’s hero/ine—can be figured as outside of heteronormative strictures. This outside-ness, moreover, is linked to the wilderness’ dissociation from patriarchal governance. Not only in <em>Silence</em>, then, but perhaps in the genre more broadly, gender prescriptivism is seen as yoked to social structures, and medieval poets—and their audiences—are left to imagine what might lie beyond their bounds. <strong> [End Page 19] </strong></p>

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f17" href="#f17-text">17.</a> Kinoshita stresses that Ebain’s endorsement of Cador and Eufemie’s marriage and his conferral of Cornwall upon them is an assertion of his own power: ‘[i]n promising the couple a feudal honor that would have been Eufemie’s (1453) but for his own ban on female inheritance, Ebain asserts royal control over the transmission of fiefs while settling the important earldom of Cornwall on his own nephew’; Kinoshita, ‘Male-Order Brides,’ 67.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f18" href="#f18-text">18.</a> Lorraine Kochanske Stock argues that this episode diminishes Ebain’s power by elevating Cador’s masculine prowess.

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f19" href="#f19-text">19.</a> In this case, the ‘trade’ is rendered mutually satisfying to the extent that Eufemie, Cador’s eventual choice, very actively chooses him, as well.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f20" href="#f20-text">20.</a> ‘Malroi’ may be a reference to Ebain’s own rather flawed rule. Kinoshita summarizes his ‘unimpressive’ qualities in ‘Male-Order Brides,’ 72. See also Stock, ‘The Importance of Being Gender “Stable,”’ 9–19.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f21" href="#f21-text">21.</a> This use of the <em>bos</em> resonates with the example from the <em>Tristan</em> romances cited by Saunders, who argues that the forest ‘highlight[s] the conflict between social responsibility and individual passion by providing the space in which the love of Tristan and Iseult may be lived out’; Saunders, <em>The Forest of Medieval Romance</em>, p. ix. Likewise, in <em>Aucuassin et Nicolette</em>, <em>Le Vair Palefroi</em>, and <em>La Fille du Comte de Pontieu</em>, ‘the forest becomes an idyllic refuge for the hunted lovers.’ Saunders, <em>The Forest of Medieval Romance</em>, p. 95.</p></div>

Langley, and Brian J. Levy, <em>Old French-English Dictionary</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 16.

Heldris’ concept of Nature does resonate with some modern theorizations of nature as a social construct, where ‘“Nature” refers to accepted standards of behavior for different “kinds or types.”’ The danger of this usage, notes Erika Cudworth, arises when the social-constructivist definition of ‘nature’ is conflated with the biological understanding ‘in order to justify the domination of certain groups of humans and other animals, which have been designated “natural.”’ See Cudworth, <em>Developing Ecofeminist Theory: The Complexity of Difference</em> (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), p. 12.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f33" href="#f33-text">33.</a> Silence’s apparent lack of any sexual desire places him/her out of range of the discourses surrounding the dangerous tribade of the Middle Ages.

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f34" href="#f34-text">34.</a> The difficulty of articulating and sustaining the binary between nature and culture is also a problem in contemporary feminism and ecofeminism. According to Diana Fuss, the tendency to favor constructionism over essentialism had, by the 1989 publication of her book, created an ‘impasse in feminism’ that was ‘predicated on the difficulty of theorizing the social in relation to the natural.’ Essentialism, she argues, is ultimately ‘<em>essential</em> to social constructionism’; Fuss, <em>Essentially Speaking: Feminism, Nature, and Difference</em> (New York: Routledge, 1989), p. 1. Stacy Alaimo takes up Fuss’s argument in her ecocritical study, arguing that ‘The rigidity of the nature/culture dichotomy has reverberated throughout much of feminist theory’; Alaimo, <em>Undomesticated Ground: Recasting Nature as Feminist Space</em> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000), p. 11.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f56" href="#f56-text">56.</a> Rudd remarks that, while the wilderness is conceived of as outside of the social, discussion of its significance tends to revolve around quintessentially social concerns. Within medieval literature, the wilderness is often resistant to description—being described by what it is not rather than what it is—which furthers this sense of its being essentially an imagined construct that, in a seeming paradox, demonstrates how difficult it is for humans to imagine a world in which we are not at the center. Rudd, <em>Greenery</em>, p. 96. This point resonates with William Marvin’s observation that ‘“forest” is primarily a cultural construct, and it can act, furthermore, as a trope for hegemony.’ William Perry Marvin, <em>Hunting Law and Ritual in Medieval English Literature</em> (Woodbridge, UK: D.S.
