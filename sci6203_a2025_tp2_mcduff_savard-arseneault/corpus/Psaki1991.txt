# Introduction

## The Problem of Authorship

The Roman de Silence is a 6,700-1ine
romance in Old French written in the second
half of the thirteenth century. If its length
and form--octosyllabic rhyming couplet--are
standard.in early French romance, little else
about the text is. Silence would seem to be
an extraordinary work by any measure, with
several unique elements which immediately
guarantee its interest for modern critics.
The text features, for example, a heroine
raised as a boy and excelling in knightly
activities; a debate between Nature and
Nurture, on which of the two will ultimately
determine Silence' s character and destiny;
a hypothesis that gendered responses are not
innate; and an explicit meditation on the
ethics and politics of disinheriting women.
The plot is compelling in itself, and all the
more so because it occurs in a chivalric
romance of self- -discovery and self— —conquest.
Yet Silence, which survives in a single
manuscript well- known to scholars and editors
in this century, remained unedited in full
until 1967, and has only recently attracted
any real critical attention.

The author of the Roman de Silence names
himself in the opening and closing lines of
the romance:

Master Heldris of Cornwall
wrote these verses just as they are.
(1-2)

Maistres Heldris de Cornualle
escrist ces Viers trestolt a talle.

Master Heldris says here and now

That one should love a good woman more

than he should hate or revile a bad
one. (6684-86)

Maistre Heldris dist chi endroit
C'on doit plus bone feme amer
Que hair malvaise u blasmer.

Even with this identification, we know
nothing at all about this person (or'persona,
on which.more later). Neither'Heldris nor'his
work is attested in any medieval document,
historical or literary. The utter void
surrounding his name is appropriate to the
particular itinerary of his text, whose very
name proclaims its non-reception history from
the Middle Ages on. Silence contains
references to 'various 'texts previous and
contemporary to it (see "Sources and
Influences" below), but the lines of
influence run only one way: no echo of
Silence has, to my knowledge, been registered
in medieval French narrative, nor is it a
presence in medievalist scholarship.

The relative obscurity of Heldris' text
has generated a new sub-genre, the Silence-
summary, present in all writing about the
romance. Rather than produce a new one, I
will quote Peter Allen's admirably concise
rendition:
Because of‘a quarrel between two counts,
King Ebain of England decrees that no
woman shall inherit property during his
reign. Ebain. marries one of his
retainers, Cador, to the daughter of the
Count of Cornwall, Eufemie (whose name
recalls that of Ebain's queen, Eufeme).
When the Count dies, Cador accedes to his
position, and, when. the couple gives
birth to a daughter, the question of
inheritance arises. The parents decide
to conceal the child's sex by naming her
Silence, reasoning that if she ever
realizes that she is female, "Silentius"
can always Ibe changed. to “Silentia.”
Silence is brought up as a boy, but when
she reaches the age of puberty Nature and
Nurture debate over her gender. She runs
away from home with a troupe of
jongleurs; her father, overcome with
grief, kills all jongleurs who come to
Cornwall. Silence, meanwhile, has
mastered the art of poetry even better
than her masters, who threaten to kill
her. She returns to Cornwall and escapes
death there because she is recognized as
the count's "son. " Queen Eufeme, ignorant
of Silence's sex, tries to seduce him
(her), and, when Silence refuses, claims
to have been his (her) victim. King'Ebain
exiles Silence to France; Eufeme
substitutes for Ebain's laissez-passer
a letter asking the King of France to
execute the bearer; the fraud is
revealed; and Silence is recalled. Eufeme
repeats her accusation, and Ebain assigns
Silence the penitential task of finding
erlin—-a task only a ‘woman can
accomplish. Silence, of course, succeeds,
and brings Merlin back to court, where
he reveals such secrets as the heroine's
true gender and the fact that Eufeme has

a lover she disguises as a nun. Eufeme

is executed; Silence is established as

a woman; and Ebain makes her his queen.

(99—100)

Since every summary is in fact a reading, it
is worth noting that Allen neglects to
mention that Silence is recalled from France
to quell the uprising of Ebain's rebellious
vassals; her knightly prowess saves his
kingdom.

Silence, then, sank without discernible
trace in its literary milieu. No maiden-
knight-jongleurs appear in later romance
plots because of Silence; no further explicit
debates between Nature and Noreture astonish
the modern reader of vernacular romance; no
further meditations on the acculturation of
"feminine" traits occupy the attention of
writers of "biographical" (single-hero)
romances. Silence arose recognizably from its
literary-cultural matrix, but seems to have
left no mark upon it. This lack of impact
persisted for many centuries. By an accident
of fate, the only manuscript which preserves
this romance apparently lay untouched and
unread for four hundred years, in an attic
in Wollaton Hall, Nottinghamshire. The
manuscript came to light again early in this
century, as W.H. Stevenson worked at
describing and cataloguing the manuscripts
belonging to Lord Middleton, the estate's
owner. Stevenson found it "in a box marked
'Old Papers--no value,‘ with letters from
Henry VIII and other old documents and
manuscripts" ~(Cowper, 1959, p. 17).
Stevenson's.Report on the Manuscripts of.Lord
Middleton, published in 1911, announced to
the medievalist public the contents of the
rediscovered manuscript, now known as
Mi.LM.6, located in the University of
Nottingham Library. It contains, in order,
the following: Le roman de Troie, Ille et
Galeron, Le roman de Silence, 4000 lines of
Le roman d 'Alixandre, La chanson d 'Aspremont,
most of La Vengeance Raguidel , four anonymous
fabliaux, 6 fabliaux by Gautier 1i Lens, and
Li dis Raoul de Hosdaing. Scholars and
editors of these other texts consulted the
codex almost immediately in order to cull
new variants, new information regarding
dating, and so on (Cowper, Sheldon,
Livingston, Armstrong). The manuscript and
its contents were consequently announced
briefly in several scholarly venues,
including Romania and the Zeitschrift fur
romanische Philologie.

The manuscript thus generated
considerable excitement, both for the texts
it transmitted and on its own account;
Frederick A.G. Cowper conducted a fascinating
hunt for the "Origins and Peregrinations of
the Laval-Middleton Manuscript" (1959).
Moving from the evidence of text and
illumination to that of published and
unpublished chartes, chronicles, catalogues,
county archives, wills, and charters, Cowper
tentatively posits that the manuscript was
made for'Anna-Béatrix (heir to the seigneurie
de Gavre) and her husband, Guy IX of Laval.
A marginal note indicates that it was still
in France in the early fifteenth century,
but by the latter part of that century it
had reached England—-brought there possibly
in 1428, subsequent to the English capture
of the Laval domain. Lewis Thorpe, I should
note, disputes Cowper's hypothesis at every
turn in his introduction to Silence.

My point here is that medievalist
scholars read and disputed the Laval-
Middleton manuscript--but not the Roman de
Silence. Stevenson initially described the
manuscript thus:

Of volumes of exclusively literary
interest the most noteworthy is an early
thirteenth-century MS . of French romances
and fabliaux, several of which are
inedited, written in the Picard dialect
(p. 221), which introduces a new figure,
that of Master Heldris de Cornvalle, into
the crowded gallery of the poets of the
Arthurian cycle (p. 224). (xii)

Apparently the gallery was too crowded,
however, or the figure of Master Heldris too
incongruous, for this romance to merit
enthusiastic reception by Arthurian scholars .
Silence was known, or at least talked about;
but it was apparently unrecognizable as a
text to be rediscovered for the romance
tradition, let alone one which would modify
the taxonomy of that tradition--until Lewis
Thorpe began in the late 1950's to edit it.

Thorpe's edition appeared serially in
Nottingham Mediaeval Studies from 1961 to
1967, accompanied by an exemplary study of
the manuscript, miniatures, language of the
poet and scribe, phonology, morphology,
proper names, possible dates, and so cum
Still, Silence continued to receive virtually
no critical attention; only gradually, since
its publication in book form in 1972, have
medievalists begun to examine Silence in a
specifically literary light. At present I
know of few articles devoted exclusively to
Silence, or referring to it in any detail.
And yet this text, more than any single
"unjustly-neglected masterpiece," merits
close study for what it can tell us about how
the modern construction of the Middle Ages
has dictated which texts will be recognized,
and which will remain invisible--and silent.

To insist in this way on the silencing
of this text--not, after all, willfully
suppressed, but simply unregistered--is
neither pointless nor precious. The image of
speech which remains unheard is intrinsically
relevant to the issue of our "reading" of the
Middle Ages, a "reading" which is less an act
of listening than of generation and
interpretation: in reading the Middle Ages
we construct it, speak it. Assumptions and
parameters which antedate our formation as
medievalists have established what we will
be ready to hear from and about the period
we study, and what we will be prepared to
answer back. While medievalists worked within
a fairly stable generic category labeled
"Arthurian Romance," of which Chrétien was
the touchstone and Malory the dissolution,
they could not see an Arthurian romance with
a cross-dressing heroine as its knight
errant. While critics held stable assumptions
regarding misogyny as the default mode, the
unreflective reflex, of medieval literature,
they could not make room for a text in which
Nature and Noreture take the stage as
allegorical personae and quarrel over which
of the two determines character, destiny, and
true gender. What this text had to say-—a
dissenting vote in the unanimous misogyny
which medieval studies had posited for its
period--was not heard. Thus the title later
given to Silence resonates in many more keys
than simply that of the heroine's name, or
the secret of her sex, or the author's broad
wink at the familiar topos of female
loquacity.

Not in the spirit of recrimination, then,
but in order to scrutinize a chapter of
medieval studies, it is useful to consider
why, even after the manuscript resurfaced,
the Roman de Silence remained an inaudible
text for so many decades. Clearly this work
neither matched the description earlier
current of the "canonical" romance (the
twelfth-century model , part Bildungsroman and
part miroir des Chevaliers), nor responded
particularly to the questions that readers
(shapers) of the genre might want to ask it.
It was, perforce, mute to the perceptual
categories they imposed on it, and
unresponsive to the particular proddings
motivated by their experience of the romances
defined as canonical. This text represented
only an absence, a failure to conform to
expectations. No young knight (despite the
promising beginning) to follow to maturity;
no merveilleux, otherworldly adventures to
decode as symbolic landscape; no particular
signs of such privileged medieval discourses
as courtly love, caritas versus cupiditas,
and so on. As an Arthurian romance it is
marginal, containing only a surprising Merlin
episode (see below) and Silence's outburst
against Uther and Arthur; no Arthurian
scholar found it compelling.

It is beyond my scope here to examine
what, in the field of medieval studies as a
whole, was at stake in establishing the
romances of Chrétien, or Hartmann for that
matter, as the canonical standard or norm by
which to measure later ones. The need for a
stable model dictated a deadpan reading of
these first romances, obviating a priori the
notion that Chrétien may have deliberately
undercut even his ablest heroes (although his
more clearly ironic distance from Perceval
was always noted). More recent criticism,
with less invested in a consistent romance
pattern, can admit to finding Erec more
disturbing, Yvaijlless.courtois, and Lancelot
more absurd, than might befit a model knight.
But Silence did not follow any recognizable
romance structure; rather, her troubled
itinerary from knightly perfection to self-
knowledge as a woman, culminating in a
successful bride-quest (her own), seems an
overt inversion of the trajectory which
critics identified in Chrétien's knights. Her
story, therefore, did not register.

It is entirely possible that it simply
did not get read with particular care; this
would offer an alternative explanation for
the lack of response to such revolutionary
features as the gender-disguise plot, the
Nature-Nurture debate which the romance both
comprises and. explicitly stages, and its
partisan narrative stance which flatly
contradicts the plot's own assumptions and
exigencies. In every sense that counts,
Silence was uniquely ignored. Yet when we
look at the reception-history in the past
two hundred years of other thirteenth-century
French romances, we find a similar if less
extreme disengagement on the part of literary
scholars. Relatively little work is done on
the Roman du Chételain de Coucy,the Roman de
la Poire, Guillaume de Dole, or the Roman de
la Violette, let alone the Tournoi de
Chauvency. With affection or derision these
are dubbed romans réalistes, simply because
they are not romans merveilleux; they do not
dabble excessively ﬁx: the archetypal, the
magical, or the Arthurian; they use proper
names and place-names of recognizable
provenance if uncertain identity. Clearly,
it is time to rediscuss our assumptions about
the romance genre, taking into account the
evidence of such contestatory voices in the
tradition as that of Heldris.

Whatever Silence's past, its future looks
sunnier; the appearance of several
particularly' fine articles on it (Allen,
Bloch, Cooper, Perret) in the past several
years suggests that it will probably be read,
taught, and written about for some time to
come. As more readers engage this text,
however, it becomes clear that it can still
only say what its readers are ready to
receive. If Howard Bloch finds in the figure
of Silence an analogue for the trouvere's
art, Peter'Allen.locates the romance's center
in its very affirmation of ambiguity in words
and gender; if Kathleen Brahney sees it as
a deproblematized and partisan exploration
of what women can do when social and
psychological barriers are removed, Kate
Cooper reads the woman in this text as the
perennially lost textual object, the figure
for textuality itself, and its simultaneous
articulation and suppression in writing:

...silence within this text is the most
profound figure of poetic enterprise, an
integral part of poetic production
compared time and again to the absent,
unheard, and unseen female body. Silence
as a linguistic phenomenon and as a
textual figure is at once the
representation of that object of desire
which stimulates the poet's speech, and
the subject--ineffable, unattainable,
irreducible--of his verse. (344)

The speech of this text will still in large
part be determined by the questions we ask
of it, the categories of information which
we are prepared to receive from it.

## Artistic Achievement

We shall turn now from considering what
Silence lacked that made it uninteresting to
medievalists, to what Silence contains that
makes it compelling to us now. First and most
obviously, the romance challenges standard
assignments of gender to roles as seen in the
"biographical" romances which antedate it.
Even at its surface this text distinguishes
itself from the body of literary and
philosophical texts which medieval literary
study has canonized. What other texts,
especially of this genre, deal overtly with
the legal status of female inheritance, or
take it for granted that absolute chivalric
and poetic preeminence are within reach of
a woman--without ever even discussing the
issue? The narrator offers no explanation or
apology for the fact that this most perfect
of women can be a perfect.knight, even saving
her king's throne when some of his vassals
rebel. It is apparently assumed that, freed
of the various constraints of a "female"
upbringing, women can disprove even the most
commonplace accusations of the antifeminist
diatribe. Hence, clearly, one of the
resonances of 'the Iheroine's name-—she is
innocent of stereotypical female
garrulousness.

Another exceptional feature is the
presence, in all her Chartrian splendor, of
Natura formatrix as the immediate creator of
Silence. She makes the girl out of the finest
materials, using a perfect mold which she had
never allowed herself to use before, in order
to create the epitome of a woman. Bloch
assumes that Silence's author knew the De
planctu Naturae of.Alain.de Lille; and indeed
the subtlety of this text's configurations
of body and.clothing, reality and text, truth
and representation, supports his reading:

Just like these details, in truth,
that I've put into the simile,
just so indeed does Nature... (1823-25)

Can you not often find

a base and low heart, and a fair body

which is a rough garment outside?

The body is nothing but another rough
garment. (1842-45)

Tolt si com cis fait sans dotance
Que chi ai mis en la sanblance,
Si fait Nature, c'est la some...

Ne poés vos sovent trover

Vil cuer et povre, et riche cors
Kist sarpelliere par defors?

Li cors n'est mais fors sarpelliere.

Bloch' s canny alignment of the poet' 5 (and
Nature's) writing of Silence with the issues
of correct 'versus perverted. writing, and
representation in general, reveals precisely
how intricate is this poet's theorizing on
these issues, beneath.his narrator's direct,
bluff, and seemingly simple exposition.

Nature, even thus problematized by an
analogy with the poetic process, is less
inherently unusual a personage in chivalric
romance than her counterpart Nurture
(Noreture); to find the two together,
personified and ready to come to blows, is
positively revolutionary. Those readers who
thought that. the explicit formulation in
these terms of this opposition was a modern
acquisition. will be surprised to see it
expressed later in the text in terms of the
raw and the cooked (5948- 58). The first
debate between. Nature and. Noreture takes
place when Silence reaches puberty, and her
nature begins to reproach her for her
unnatural life (2500-2688). Noreture arrives
to defend Silence's upbringing:

"Curse you, Nature,
leave my nursling alone.

I have completely denatured her.

She will never succumb to you.

If you do not leave off these visits
you will be able to boast only

that through environment I can make
a thousand people work against nature.
All in all, I easily train

a noble child into a bad man.

I will undo all your speech.

Nature, begone, and take the child's
shame away with you." (2593-2604)

"Lassciés ester ma norecon,
Nature, a la maleycon.

Jo l'ai tolte desnaturee.

N'avra ja voir a vus duree.

Se ne lassciés icest anter

Bien vos pores a1 loig vanter

Se jo ne fac par noreture

.m. gens ovrer contre nature.

Jo noris tres bien, c'est la some,
D'un noble enfant un malvais home.
Jo te desferai tolt ton conte.
Nature, envoiés o sa honte."

Although Noreture wins this round, Nature
will be back again at the end of the romance
to claim her due. Ultimately, however,
Heldris has opened up a speculative space in
which the two may contest; he will not opt
for any dogmatic manifesto in favor of
either.

The indeterminacy posited in Silence for
sex roles, sexual difference, language,
writing, representation, appearance,
clothing, names, and so on, results--
inevitably, according to Bloch, Cooper, and
Perret--in a kind of radical linguistic
indeterminacy at the level of the text
itself. Cooper stresses this dissolution of
sense most strongly, inviting into the text
all the phonetic and graphemic variants
imaginable in certain particularly loaded
passages:

And he answered: Such a thing I never heard!
Silencius [Silence]! Who am I then?
I have the name Silencius [Silence],
I believe,
[or]
I do not have Silencius [Silence]
Or I am other than I was.
But this I know well, by my right hand,
That I cannot be other!
Therefore I am Scilentius [Silence],
It seems to me, or I am nothing.
[01']
It seems to me, or I am nude.
(2532-38, tr. Cooper)

Et cil respont: Tel n'oi onques!
Silencius! qui sui jo donques?
Silencius ai non, jo cui,

U jo sui altres que ne fui.

Mais cho sai jo bien, par ma destre,
Que jo ne puis pas altres estre!
Donques sui jo Scilentius,

Cho m'est avis, u jo sui nus."

Cooper is certainly right to emphasize the
fact that the romance enacts, as well as
thematizing, the instability of language and
its undecidability, though my translation
cannot reflect all such wordplay. I urge the
reader instead to return to Thorpe's edition
and read the original, to let the textual
articulation float free of its narrative
burden.

All such intricate (and semantically
charged) wordplay aside, the Roman de Silence
incorporates quite a few broader examples of
humor as well. The reader may read straight,
for example, such lines as "que poi en falt
que il n'est malles" [little is lacking for
him to be a male, 2477], or may instead stop
and reflect on exactly what it is that is
still lacking in Silence's masculinity. The
laughter the line may generate reinforces,
rather than undermines, the romance's
thematic of the contingent nature of sexual
difference and gender identity. The narrative
tension generated by the queen's second
attempt at seducing Silence, and her success
at persuading the king that Silence had
attempted to rape her, is dissipated by the
following exchange:

He had the boy brought before him,

and said at once to the lady:

"Fair one, if you will be guided by me,

we may yet get some good out of this."

"What?" she asked. "Something besides
hanging him?"

"Exactly! He will not suffer that."

"Then what do you want to do with him,

sire?
Burn him, or draw and quarter him?"
"Neither, fair one..." (4224—32)

Le vallet fait traire ensus d'els

Et a dit a la dame en oire:

"Biele, se vos me voles croire,

Bon consel porons de cho prendre.——
Comment? fait ele. El que del pendre?--
Oil! n'avra pas tel martyre.——

Que li volés donc faire, sire?

Ardoir, u a chevals detraire?--

Ne mie, bele...

The queen is momentarily ridiculous, since,
as we know and she does not, the king has no
intention of executing Silence. This
narrative move disarms the audience for her
next, more malevolent step: the substitution
of Silence's letter with a death-warrant. At
the end of the romance, however, it is the
queen who is drawn and quartered for adultery
and treachery.

Humor is a constant in the romance, and
often at the narrator's expense: his persona
is not always particularly' dignified, or
learned, or alive to the sophistication of
the tale he tells. Heldris will not be
heralded as a new Chrétien. His rhyming
couplets are workmanlike rather than
masterful; his narrating voice is earnest and
frequently leaden rather than elegantly
, omniscient; and his plot is strongly ad hoc
rather than (pretending to the) archetypal.
Yet his control of his text is light and
sure, in the sense that his obtrusive
narrator is no accident: he is simply another
strategy by which to place in the foreground
the various problematics of the romance. The
deliberately unsophisticated 'voice, which
frequently interrupts to tell us a patently
less complex version of what we are reading,
calls for us to comment on it and its
perspective, as well as on those sections of
the text which seem to escape it. The author
has created a narrating voice which is not
quite up to the ambiguities of the tale it
tells, much in the way Chaucer's Troilus
narrator and Man of Law never rise to the
ambiguities and challenges of their
narratives. Thus the Roman de Silence may be
said to carry more speculative freight than
its narrator acknowledges or addresses, and
to carry it on two distinct planes.

If the narrator is frequently unsubtle,
however, the poet is not. Silence's creator
knows, for example, how to suppress the
narratorial voice and its perspective in
favor of a character. The narrator is a
staunch supporter of his protagonist, yet he
presents--without such qualification as
direct discourse--the two jongleurs'
jaundiced view of Silence:

Rage rushed to their hearts,

for their performance was rebuffed
on account of a swine

who wasn't worth a button. (3245-48)

Li diols lor est es cuers colés
Que lor mestiers est refolés
Tolt par l'afaire d'un gloton,
Ki pas ne valoit un boton.

This switch of narratorial perspective is
unusual in my experience. Chrétien, for
example, presents direct discourse in which
his heroes' enemies deride their opponents,
or boast of their own inevitable victory,
but he does not to my knowledge have the
narrating voice speak for the opposition,
however' briefly. The narrator' of‘ Silence
shifts frequently in this way; the erotic
desperation of Cador and Euphemie, the
indignation of Nature and the presumption of
Noreture, and so on, are presented in the
third person by this technique of floating
perspective.

The narrator's "real" stance remains
clear to us for the most part, despite his
empathetic narration. Still, this quirk of
presenting events from more than one
perspective reinforces another of the
romance's values, which Heather Lloyd
emphasizes: prudence in judging. Rarely does
an authority—figure set up for admiration
make a decision alone and unmeditated in this
romance, and when it does happen the results
are disastrous. Thus Ebain consults with his
barons and takes their advice about his own
marriage and. that of Cador; but. when. he
vengefully disinherits all women in his
realm, the decision is set up as wrongheaded
and counterproductive (though useful in
narrative terms, to generate the plot). The
King of France, caught in a dilemma over the
request to execute Silence, asks for advice
from three of his counts, who weigh the
merits, ethical and pragmatic, of executing
the boy.

These consultations do not, moreover,
take place off-stage. We are present at the
conferences, and. the narrator quotes the
speakers in full, representing conflicting
viewpoints in full. No one is made to appear
ridiculous, even if the narrator's implied
endorsement goes to one particular character;
after all, honest people differ. We see the
other characters' responses, both interior
and expressed, as a lesson in diplomacy and
persuasive discourse:

He could hardly say a word

out of rage at what he had heard;

but he restrained his fury

like a wise man, and spoke courteously.

He did not want to contradict Blois

immediately, nor yet consent;

for he only fans the flames

who tries to stop the mouth

of the one he wants to contradict.

A man who does that weakens his case.

Instead, he must first concede
everything

in order to better mollify his fellow.

(4585-96)

A paines qu'il puet dire mot

De maltalent de cho qu'il ot;

Mais qu'il refrainst son maltalent
Com sages hom, si parla gent.

Ne le Violt mie desmentir

Al premier mot, ne consentir:

Car cil met 1e fu en l'estoppe

Ki a1 premier le bouce estoppe

De celui que voeI-contredire.

Hom qui cho fait, son plait empire,
Ainz doit premiers tolt otroier,
Por miols son per amoloier.

The hovering eye of the narrator, presenting
first one view of a situation and then
another, may well be simply advocating the
pragmatism which makes respect for other
perspectives desirable, as Lloyd says. Or he
may be recalling the contingency of "actual
reality" which makes it problematic to
privilege one version of it over another.
More portentously, he reminds us that
language--like clothing--constitutes the
reality we know, as Silence's reality for
almost all her interlocutors is constituted
by the clothing, manners, and activities she
adopts--her social "language, " her non—verbal
signs. (Even her father, the author of
Silence's imposture, is never seen--in direct
or indirect discourse, spoken or thought--to
allude to his daughter as female, once he has
explained her disguise to her.)

What, then, does the author--or the
narrator, for that matter--conclude or
suggest about gender? More specifically, are
gendered qualities innate for him? Again, he
may have a suspicion, but he does not
discount the other'possibilities either. The
second Nature-Nurture debate, which balances
and overturns the first, is not about
Silence; the direct provocation is the figure
of Merlin, a man who has become like an
animal (wandering in the forest, eating raw
plants, drinking only water, etc.). Nature
and Nurture here accuse each other of being
the origin of evil in the human race; since
evil originated with Adam and Eve, who had
no nurture to corrupt'them but could not
possibly have been corrupt by Nature, which
is to blame? Nature clearly wins this round,
yet ultimately it is only the Merlin
narrative unit that is at stake. No innate
femininity, no gender-based weakness or
predisposition, betrays Silence in the way
that Merlin's innately human longings make
him susceptible 'to ‘the lure of 'wine and
cooked meat. Only Merlin betrays Silence,
when. he breaks his obstinate silence to
speak, by knowing the fact of her biological
gender. Although Nature has created in her
the ultimate woman, nothing about Silence
leads to her "downfall."

Silence does, of course, contribute to
her own unmasking’ when she captures and
brings back Merlin, a feat only'a woman could
perform. Nothing but the technical fact of
her sex accounts for this; if gendered
qualities are not innate, then, obviously
gender still is. According to the plot,
clearly, the repercussions of that biological
fact can be minimal, even nil. Not for
nothing does this text present a woman
warrior and poet-performer whose successes
in these categories outstrip all her male
competitors. If Allen and Brahney maintain
that the romance's plot does not ultimately
challenge the certainties of gender-based
identity, they may not be weighting
adequately the radical premises of this text,
which I would not hesitate to call at least
proto-feminist. The narrator does not bother
to trot out and explicitly refute the old
saws about female nature, at least not with
regard to Silence; for the most part, the
asides to the effect that "feme est de tele
nature" [woman's nature is such...] are
provoked by Eupheme, the king's wife. The
critical juncture of Silence and female
nature occurs only in the epilogue, which
becomes more and more opaque the more we look
at it.

The layering of narration in the text is
dense, and.nowhere more so than at its close.
Throughout the text we have an obtrusive but
unstable narrating voice, which contradicts
itself explicitly and implicitly. The
epilogue claims to derive a lesson from
Silence, a conclusion about nature in general
and female nature in particular, which
conclusion however has been thoroughly
disproven in the romance itself:

Master Heldris says here and now

that one should love a good woman more

than one should hate or revile a bad
one.

I would show you the true reason:

for a woman has less opportunity

to have the time and chance

to be good than to be evil,

if she works diligently against nature.

[6684-91]

Maistre Heldris dist chi endroit
C'on doit plus bone feme amer
Que hair malvaise u blamer.

Si mosterroie bien raison,

Car feme a menor oquoison

Por que ele ait 1e liu ne l'aise
De l'estre bone que malvaise,
S'ele ouevre bien contre nature.

The distinction between Eupheme and Silence
is made a few lines down; yet there is no
coherence to the sequence of placating
remarks which Heldris makes in backing his
way out of his text. If women have less
occasion or cause to be good than to be evil,
and Silence is this text's exception, does
that mean that her upbringing--with male
activities, concerns, freedoms--made the
difference? But Eupheme has another antitype,
Silence's mother Euphemie (the names alone
invite the comparison) , who is perfectly good
and virtuous :h1 her own (female) sphere.
"Contre nature" indicates the narrator's
conviction--borne out by the last Nature-
Nurture debate-~that women are tendentially
inclined towards evil. But is not the
narrator traducing his tale, or does not the
overwhelming evidence of the tale bely his
superficial conclusion? Ultimately we must
look skeptically at the explicit assertions
of a narrator who simplifies or reverses the
complexities of his tale; and I would argue
that the author of Silence intended us to
read his ponderous narrator with more than
a grain of salt.

The romance' s double perspective--a
sophisticated tale told by a simple tel-
ler--contributes to what Peter Allen refers
to as an apparent conventionality:

Heldris's poem, on the surface, seems
unlikely to threaten anyone's notions of
what medieval literature is all about.
[...]...the text does not appear to
challenge our way of thinking. (98)

Indeed, Silence does end up relinquishing
her male persona and marrying the king, a
conventional ending for such revolutionary
premises. But the fact of the ending does
not negate or neutralize the radical events
that preceded it. The universe remains
disturbed: commonplaces about biological and
social gender have still been shaken, and.the
pat ending with its pat commentary do not
successfully repair the rift in the
conceptual fabric.

## Sources and Influences

As I noted above, Silence had no
immediately identifiable imitations in
medieval literature, although it is far from
being without precursor or heir. Its actual
impact on its literary context is difficult
to assess, since the surrounding material has
not been combed for echoes of Heldris's
romance. Other texts which exist in unique
manuscripts-~such as Flamenca, or'Hartmann's
Erec--have been much more attentively studied
than Silence has yet had time to be. That we
find. no direct allusions to it in. other
medieval works is no clear indication of its
obscurity, nor is the existence of other
maiden-knights in literature a sure
indication that Silence was known and
adapted.

Michele Perret discusses three analogous
cases of female transvestitism in Old French,
in Huon de Bordeaux, L'Estoire Merlin (the
source for the final episode of Silence), and
Tristan de Nanteuil. Silence is unique among
them in several respects: in being
constructed entirely around this motif, in
explicitly staging the Nature-Noreture
debates, and in making the masquerade overtly
a question of female nature, among others.
Still, it is clear that Heldris' work had
resonances 5J1 its time. Heldris' plot is
perhaps not so revolutionary after all; the
Middle Ages could and did posit a more
nuanced view of women than the familiar Eve—
Mary dichotomy could encompass, and this is
all to the good. As Perret shows, the
combined evidence of Yde from .Huon,
Grisandole from L'Estoire Merlin, and
Blanchandine from Tristan de Nanteuil , reveal
the sexual and referential instabilities at
stake in this tale-type:

The extreme instability of the sign, and
especially the problematic relation of
the sign to its referent, is revealed
most particularly in this area of sexual
difference.

It is this problem of reference
which brings into these narratives of
sexual ambiguity a whole play of
language... (334)

The same thematic in late Italian epic--
vehicled in Bradamante in the Orlando
Furioso, and in Clorinda in the Gerusalemme
Liberata--results in. the exposure of 'the
instabilities which lie close beneath the
surface of both language and sexual
difference.

Heldris mentions the Breton lais Gueron
(Gurun?) and Mabon in the context of
Silence's performance as a jongleur; and
indeed, Eupheme's attempt to seduce Silence,
and her vengeful mood upon failing, could be
taken from any number of lais (Lanval,
Graelent, Guingamory etc.). The topos is
sufficiently diffuse, of course, that it.does
not need a direct antecedent. Still, the
allusion and analogous episode serve to
locate Silence in a specific literary milieu,
just as the episode in which Silence
disguises herself to become a jongleur echoes
the adventure of another notably intrepid
heroine, Nicolette in Aucassin et Nicolette.
Again, whether the similarity is due to
borrowing or simply to a shared literary
matrix, the analogy brings Silence into the
humorous, even parodic, world of the
chantefable.

In sum, Silence's sources and influences,
with one exception, are general and diffuse.
The exception is, of course, the closing
episode, taken virtually intact from
L'Estoire Merlin (c. 1230). In this episode,
Ebain and Eupheme send Silence to capture
Merlin; since he can only be taken by a
woman, the king and queen are certain that
Silence will fail. Silence too is certain of
her imminent failure; but an enigmatic
figure, who, we are invited to think, is
Merlin himself, comforts Silence and shows
him the stratagems which can capture the
magician. Although Merlin has long been
living as a wild man, his human nature can
betray him into being lured by the smell of
cooked meat and the desire for wine. When
Merlin sets out after the cooked meat, Nature
and Noreture again take center-stage to
defend their respective positions. This time
Nature routs Noreture in short order,
preparing us for the conclusion of the
romance in which Silence's female nature will
be vindicated. ,

The force of this episode is such that,
for Lewis Thorpe, Heldris "composed lines 1-
5647 of his poem to lead up to and explain
this final episode" (32). Heather Lloyd, for
different reasons, agrees (88). Critics seem
to agree generally that Heldris ultimately
reinforces the status quo (Perret, 329) with
his apparently regressive ending, a judgment
which their heavy weighting of the final
episode generates. As I have suggested,
however, the closing off of the speculative
space does not by any means have the force
of never having opened it up at all; and we
are quite possibly invited to scrutinize the
bluff and ingenuous conclusions of the
narrating voice.

In conclusion, Silence is, indeed,
unusual--but less with reference to its own
cultural context than in comparison to the
construct of medieval misogyny in general,
and of Arthurian romance ingparticular, which
medieval studies has handed down to us.
Silence is unusual, but not an orphan: as
Perret demonstrates, other French authors
framed in similar terms the questions of
gender as innate or constructed. Even without
these immediate analogues, however, there is
sufficient evidence in canonical texts that
historians and literary historians alike have
exaggerated the homogeneity of medieval
attitudes toward gender (as toward religion,
cosmology, politics, and other issues). We
need to incorporate the evidence of the
minority voices, both within the canon and
without; and the Roman de Silence is an
important part of that process.

## Editorial Policy for this Translation

With very few exceptions, I have based
this translation on Lewis Thorpe's edition,
published in book form by Heffer in 1972.
Consultation of the original manuscript has
yielded few essential emendations; most of
these involve changes to Thorpe's sentence
divisions, although occasionally I have also
changed a word in accordance with my reading
of the manuscript. I understand that the
unique manuscript of Silence, Mi.LM.6, is
currently in restoration and will not be
available for consultation in the near
future.

Although I wished to remain faithful to
the letter of the original, in translating
the text I have dispensed with certain
characteristics of Old French narrative
poetry which read awkwardly in English. I
have stabilized verb tenses in sequences in
which, as readers of Old French know, the
original would shift. between jpresent and
past; I have inserted subject markers where
their absence 'would confuse the English-
speaking reader; and I have revised word
order to conform to English syntax, although
I tried to respect original line format. In
the translator's perennial negotiation
between the literal and the mellifluous, I
have erred in the direction of the former;
certain stilted collocations are therefore
my responsibility, not Heldris'. Ultimately
my hope is, of course, that readers will go
back to the Roman de Silence, and let it
speak for itself; thus I have retained
Thorpe's original line numbers to facilitate
comparison with his edition.

I would like to express my gratitude to
several people who were instrumental in the
project of translating Silence. I first
learned of the existence of the work from
Joan Ferrante of Columbia University, in a
lecture she delivered at Cornell University
in late 1985; I thank: her sincerely for
bringing the romance to my attention. Alice
Colby-Hall and James S. Noblitt of Cornell
taught me Old French; they are however
innocent of what imperfections remain in my
mastery of the language. James J. John of
Cornell taught me paleography, the door
through which we touch the hand that wrote,
and meet the eye that corrected, our texts.
Professor Mario Mancini of the Universita
degli Studi, Bologna, graciously allowed me
the use of a miniature but splendidly-
equipped library in the Palazzo Ercolani in
1987; that library's resources and
tranquillity were essential to my initial
translation project. Professor James J.
Wilhelm offered his patience and expertise
in equal measure, and I am very grateful to
him for both. Finally, to my medievalist
colleagues at Cornell, who took issue with
the conventional wisdom regarding the role
of women in medieval literature, this
translation is dedicated: Gayle Margherita,
Disa Gambera, Wendy Peek, Karen Swenson,
Kerry Shea, Janet Durholz, Debby Berman,
Sarah Anderson, and Karen Cherewatuk.
