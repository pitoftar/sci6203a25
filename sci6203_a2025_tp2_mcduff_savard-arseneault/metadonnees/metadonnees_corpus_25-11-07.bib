  abstract = {Apart from discourse and yet somehow part of it, silence is a powerfully ambiguous linguistic phenomenon that blurs the lines between presence and absence. Eluding the material aspects of oral and written language, it is only perceptible as the gaps or spaces between words. Nonetheless, it plays a role in all linguistic productions: although silence itself cannot be directly communicated, it can influence communication. In a literary text, silence may takes on many different guises, including rhythmic hesitations, rhetorical omissions, and poetic oppositions that mimic the audible gaps of spoken language. The visual, aural, and fictional interaction of all these components ultimately induces otherwise unnamed meanings, meanings that exist as part of the symbolic network of a text, yet beyond the division and difference of signifiers. And while traces of this phenomenon may be found in literature from all historical periods and genres, the three medieval romances in which I have chosen to explore it—La Vie de Saint Alexis, Le Conte du Graal, and Le Roman de Silence—exhibit a particularly strong awareness of the communicative problems and possibilities engendered by silence. Each one demonstrates—albeit in a slightly different way—that silence is more than just omission: within their pages, it becomes an elusive yet create force that shapes thematic development and structures poetics. Ultimately, however, silence's structuralizing force is not just textual, but also ontological, affecting our existence and perceptions of who we are.},

This article considers how textual modes of translation connect with translation’s role in subject formation in medieval texts, focusing on two narratives about female cross-dressing, the Vie de Sainte Euphrosine and the Roman de Silence. Gender emerges in these texts through multiple intersecting modes of translation which are bound up with the female protagonists’ masculine gender presentation. These narratives explore how subjectivity can be made or remade through the translation of discursive conventions that encompass linguistic, social, and familial constructions of gender. They also point to ways of connecting gender and translation in more specifically medieval literary contexts, representing gender as part of a set of translation problems associated with “genre trouble.”},

  abstract = {This dissertation provides an analysis of Heldris of Cornwall's Roman de Silence within both Insular (Anglo-Norman) and Continental narrative traditions of the thirteenth century. As this work has never been the subject of a full-length study, I seek to fill this lack by situating it within the secular and religious literature of this period. Especially critical to my narratological analysis of this work is the author's use of non-romance sources, which include Latin hagiographical narratives, proverbs, and exempla as well as historic and folkloric material associated with Celtic, Anglo-Norman and Continental literary traditions. I contend that the Roman de Silence provides an important example of how writers of the thirteenth century balanced the dual aims of docere and delectare, of instruction and entertainment. It is my belief that Heldris, an otherwise unknown poet, writes this romance as a primarily instructional work and that he adapts easily recognizable elements of romance narratives to further this goal of moral instruction. Of central interest to scholars who have examined this work has been the uniqueness of having a woman cross-dressed as a man as the protagonist. It is my contention that this choice reflects his desire to explore the tensions between Good and Evil as well as the rivalry between Nature and Norreture as aspects of every human's existence. By having a cross-dressed woman take on this role, he can explore a variety of topics generally not pursued in traditional chivalric romances while invoking the most common narrative form of the period-the narrative saint's life or vita.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines gender identity in four medieval French texts. By analyzing these works both on their own terms and in the context of modern gender theory, the present study introduces new ways of speaking about medieval gender and sexuality and corrects the current tendency to reduce transvestite identity to one side of a gender binary. The introduction compares transvestism in hagiography and secular literature and surveys criticism dealing with transvestite narrative. I challenge the assumption that gender origins and differences were uniformly seen as biological in the Middle Ages and turn to analysis of transvestite narratives as proof. Chapter one analyzes the creation and perception of transvestite identity in Le Roman de Silence, tracing the psychological and physical development of the biologically female protagonist who comes to prefer male identity. Silence's complex identity illustrates that here, gender behavior is not innate, but is rather learned or imposed. Chapter two's analysis of Le Conte du Roi Flore et de la belle Jehane shows the dual movement of a cross-dressing character who simultaneously raises and lowers her social status as she moves up the gender hierarchy, but abandons her noble rank. While class is here perceived as biologically inherited, gender is perceived as social construct. Chapter three, my analysis of Yde et Olive, traces the evolution of Yde from an undeveloped girl to a robust, male warrior. Although the hero identifies with female identity, her sex change results from the on-going transformation of her body, behavior, and others' desire. Chapter four examines the different behaviors and preferences of the two transvestites in Tristan de Nanteuil: while one fully assumes male identity, the other wears it awkwardly. Here, gender identity derives from forces other than biological sex, including individual character. One character's sex change reveals that neither sex nor gender is an immutable category. The conclusion argues that the narratives do not impart a unified statement about gender: gender is not uniformly seen as biologically derived, nor does it function as a purely cultural construct. Rather, these narratives illustrate the multiple factors responsible for identity creation and the insufficiencies of established categories.},

The chapter focuses on the Ovidian reception at play in the Roman de Silence, that has rarely been recognized in most secondary literature on Silence. The power of language is a key aspect of multiple Egyptian sources which may well have influenced Ovid’s presentation of Isis and is also key to the genre of fables. Queer self-affirmations are thus their own form of transformation, trans forming reality itself without any need for physical changes, reinforcing the legitimacy of all coming out stories, regardless of the shape they take. In conclusion, reception of Roman ideas about gender is rife within the Roman de Silence, taking Phaedrus, Ovid, Virgil as source material.},

Under the cover of Silence's cross-dressing and refeminization, the text renegotiates the way bodies mattered in the thirteenth-century imaginary, redefining the function of the medieval nobility as genealogical reproduction rather than military service.

  abstract = {From the vantagepoint of a feminist/queer/cisgender narratologist, “Trans-forming Narratology” asks which aspects of narrative practice might be particularly salient to developing a fruitful trans narratology while also calling our attention to elements of narrative that conventional (cis)narratology has undervalued or ignored. Keeping in mind matters that might be particularly relevant to trans narratives, this speculative essay explores aspects of voice, embodiment, character space, plotting, and closure in a set of recent American and British novels. It considers ways in which trans narratives can exploit the gender freedom of the first-person English pronoun or, conversely, signal temporally dual identities through heterodiegetic naming practices. It addresses tensions between a character’s proclaimed gender and their assigned sex and the differing implications of texts with narratees who are also textual actors and those whose narratees serve as external confidantes. Through brief forays into multiple aspects of narrative form, this essay argues for a narratology that can show the rich and varied capacities of trans writings past and present, with the hope that attention to trans narratives will both deepen our understanding of trans literature and advance the larger project of a comprehensive, situated narratology.},

  abstract = {Psychoanalysis and science respond to the transsexual claim of wrongful embodiment with radically different models of treatment. Yet both disciplines construct the figure of the transsexual from a heteronormative and patriarchal perspective. The 13th-century text Le Roman de Silence, which deals with the gender transformation of its heroine, Silence, is similarly biased. Moreover, this romance theorizes a relationship between gender and the body that closely parallels the psychoanalytical and scientific discourses about transsexuality. Silence's social isolation confirms the varying levels of dislocation that transsexed individuals, both male and female, attribute to their condition, but her powerlessness to determine her own gender identity is more akin to the modern treatment of intersex children. The ambiguity surrounding Silence's return to femininity at the end of the romance, however, suggests that the medieval author can see beyond the binary system of gender that structures his society and that continues to structure ours.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed rapid shifts in scholarship on trans and gender nonconforming experiences during the European Middle Ages. Despite initial concerns about such approaches being anachronistic or historically inaccurate, medievalists have begun to productively incorporate trans and intersex theory into their discussions of non-normative genders and sexualities.1 In fact, scholars of premodern gender are often explicit about their motivations beyond medieval studies, highlighting the benefits of transhistorical comparisons for marginalized communities today. For example, M. W. Bychowski suggests that readers should “become a pilgrim through trans history,” a practice that can make us “aware of our foreignness to the present moment of transgender”; to be a pilgrim is to acknowledge the limitations of one’s own perspective with respect to both current and past realities (Bychowski et al. 660–61). Similarly, Alicia Spencer-Hall and Blake Gutt present their edited collection on gender-variant saints as “offer[ing] historically grounded refutation of theological transphobia” (17). Studies in this vein suggest that uncovering a plurality of voices in the past can denaturalize modern gender norms and provide trans people with expanded senses of history and community.},

Zarówno francuski trzynastowieczny romans jak i angielska piętnastowieczna proza, opisują jak Merlin śmieje się w sposób niekontrolowany oraz początkowo nie zrozumiały dla innych. Jego śmiech jest reakcją często nie na miejscu oraz wywołuje skrajne emocje wśród innych bohaterów. Jednakże, wszystkie takie sceny spełniają specjalnie przez niego opracowane funkcje, różne dla obydwu prac. Artykuł podejmuję próbę przedstawienia oraz porównania scen śmiechu Merlina w dwóch utworach, argumentując, że nie należy traktować ich jedynie jako elementu humorystycznego. Autor twierdzi, że śmiech Merlina znacząco przyczynia się do jego ogólnej charakterystyki oraz ról przyjmowanych w dwóch narracjach.},

While the power of King Evan in the thirteenth-century Roman de Silence appears essential, theorist Michel Foucault contends power can exist only in action. Judith Butler's discourse regarding the roles of performativity and identification and the necessity of their reiteration in power relations, and the historical context provided by Ernst Kantorowicz, facilitate this analysis of the king's negotiation of power, helping to voice the narrative's resonant silences. Chapter One explores the inherited, kingly roles which afford the king a unique agency in power performances. Chapter Two discloses how King Evan exercises his rights as England's feudal overlord. Chapter Three examines the king's negotiation of power in significant relationships, the resistances that ensue from them, and the consequences for his royal agency.},

  abstract = {In the contrasting lives and fates of the rulers, husbands, vassals, and wives, and through the use of ambiguity and the manipulation of gender stereotypes in the Roman de Silence, Heldris of de Cornüalle offers a model of political and personal lordship which is founded upon consultation, consent, and self-restraint. When superiors, be they lords or husbands, provide an environment for the sharing of wisdom, both home and court nurture loyalty, good service, true liberality, and peace in vassals and wives. While Heldris's portrayal of the characteristics of good lordship is in many senses conventional, his hero(ine) and the parallels he draws between lordship and marriage affirm a very unconventional notion that women should play an active role in both governance and marriage.},

  abstract = {The handling of gender in the Old French Roman de Silence has caused considerable scholarly conflict because the poem simultaneously endorses two competing and mutually irreconcilable gender ideologies. Asserting that gender is essential and its boundaries inviolate—even as its eponymous heroine freely crosses gender boundaries to become supremely successful in male roles—the poem creates a radically unstable conception of gender that has implications not only for its portrayal of social gender roles but also for its use of gendered language. The heroine's name, Silence, becomes emblematic of language's inability to fully represent its subject, as neither Latin nor the vernacular proves adequate to the task of depicting an ambiguously or multiply gendered character. Gendered language and gendered behavior emerge as mutually dependent sources of paradox that point to the limitations of both language and narrative.},

Moving away from Bloch's focus on poetic language, this article examines the poem's systematic conflation of a woman's life with images of death and captivity. The action of the poem, and the characters within the poem, draw our attention to issues of gender performance in such a manner as to render it impossible for the poem's conservative ending to unsay or undo (to silence) the main body of the romance.},

  abstract = {This dissertation offers a reevaluation of the Old French romance genre on the basis of gender and adventure. I challenge a view of romance adventure that solely privileges the male individual, showing that models for female and coupled adventure not only exist in romance, but are numerous, serving as sites for the interrogation and transformation of the knightly model. While the concept of adventure has long been recognized as a complex and multifaceted aspect of romance fiction, the critical focus on the male protagonist has remained largely unquestioned, and in turn this focus has generated theories of narrative subjectivity based on the concept of the male individual as the subject of adventure. My study examines identity, subjectivity, and narrativity as they relate to female adventure in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Old French romance, with extensive analyses of the Roman de Silence, Aucassin et Nicolette, and Guillaume de Palerne. Importantly, these female-centered romances display an evident interest in gender, demonstrating that writers of romance fiction were conscious of the gender dynamics to which their works respond, as they sought to examine and innovate upon these dynamics in dialogue with current social and political issues. In my introduction, I set the stage for my analyses by exploring the generic horizons of romance fiction, different models for female protagonism and adventure in romance and saints’ lives, critical concepts of adventure and of the knightly protagonist, and questions of subjectivity. My first chapter, on the Roman de Silence, argues that the romance recasts adventure as a site of performative prowess in which performance itself becomes the central narrative interest and generator of conflict, resolution, and suspense, reflecting Silence’s own gendered circumstances. The forms of physical prowess that accrue to the reputation of the knightly protagonist are shown to be illusory in the case of Silence, prompting an examination of the relationship between female adventure and identity. I also show how the text emphasizes the way in which adventure is constructed through language, or as a narrative phenomenon. My second chapter presents a new reading of the chantefable Aucassin et Nicolette by looking at the work within its Occitan setting, considering this setting in light of the chantefable’s northern French audience and place of composition. I look at representations, stereotypes, and historical realities of women and gender in Occitania in order to reframe the relationship between Aucassin and Nicolette, as well as Nicolette’s active narrative role. I also consider the influence of Occitania’s multicultural market economy on the narrative’s presentation of conflict and exchange. My final chapter foregrounds the adventuring couple and takes up the tension between social identity and adventure in Guillaume de Palerne. I read Guillaume and Mélior’s adventure in relation to desire and social identity, the space of adventure and the space of the court, and desire and consent, particularly as related to marital practices. I argue that Guillaume de Palerne stages an unresolved tension between narrative adventure and the socio-political world to which its protagonists belong.},
