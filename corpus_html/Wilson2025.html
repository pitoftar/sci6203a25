<body> <p> The verb <i>consentir</i> appears ten times in Heldris of Cornwall’s thirteenth-century Old French <i>Roman de Silence</i>.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn158_1" data-content=" 1   Heldris of Cornwall, Silence: A Thirteenth-Century French Romance, ed. and trans. by Sarah Roche-Mahdi (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1992), ll. 1141, 3240, 3409, 3824, 3898, 4408, 4590, 6166, 6590, 6625.

Faced with Eufeme’s ‘ardure’ (‘lust’, 3798), Silence is frozen in ‘nonpossance’ (‘impotence’, 3875), unable to assert desires of his own.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn159_1" data-content=" 2   In line with much of Heldris’s pronoun usage, and following scholars including Robert Clark (‘Queering Gender and Naturalizing Class in the Roman de Silence’, Arthuriana, 12.1 (2002), 50–63), Victoria Blud, (The Unspeakable, Gender and Sexuality in Medieval Literature 1000–1400, Gender in the Middle Ages, 12 (Cambridge: Brewer, 2017)), and Caitlin Watt (‘“Car vallés sui et nient mescine”: Trans Heroism and Literary Masculinity in Le Roman de Silence’, Medieval Feminist Forum, 55.1 (2019), 135–73), I use masculine pronouns for Silence except where directly quoting other critics."><sup>2</sup></a> Agency is ascribed not to him, but to an unyielding <i>something</i> within him: ‘nature’, whose meanings in <i>Silence</i> range from ‘biological sex […] to moral temperament […] to class-bound character […] to the status quo of gender roles’, has a powerful will of its own.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn160_1" data-content=" 3   Roberta Krueger, Women Readers and the Ideology of Gender in Old French Verse Romance (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 117."><sup>3</sup></a></p> <p> That will is asserted throughout the poem, its force concentrated in a personified allegory. Nature is the creatrix who claims Silence as ‘ma fille’ (‘my girl’, 1927) even before his birth, insisting on that gendering through several debates with personified Nurture. Her eventual ‘victory’ sees Silence transformed from swashbuckling knight to wordless wife. Nature subjects Silence and other gender-nonconforming characters to her desires with fierce strength. Her voice is vituperative, possessive, tugging at Silence in language that sometimes evokes sexualised violence. Contrasted with domineering Nature, Silence — assigned female at birth, raised a boy to secure his inheritance, a troubadour, knight, courtier, and, following the public revelation of his sex, queen of England — appears remarkably passive. Glimmers of his will towards masculine identification are repeatedly snuffed out. His very name bespeaks a voice drowned out by others’ demands. To quote Victoria Blud, <i>Silence</i> is ‘as much Nature’s [drama] as Silence’s’, if not more so: we could even read Nature as the <i>roman</i>’s real heroine, temporarily bested by Nurture during Silence’s boyhood, biding her time until she can claim his womanhood as her prize.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn161_1" data-content=" 4   Blud, Unspeakable, p. 99."><sup>4</sup></a></p> <p> If we stay with Silence’s muffled voice, however, we find a much less triumphal narrative. Instead, we must sit with the grief and fury aroused by a grimmer tale, one with uncomfortable resonances for modern transgender readers: a gender-nonconforming subject is slowly dragged into line with cis-normative expectations, slotted into their ‘natural’ role in the reproductive economy. <i>Silence</i> ends with its hero, stripped before the court, submitting to the king’s ‘plaisir’ (‘pleasure’, 6628), before Nature arrives to forcibly feminise her creation. The protagonist does not triumph in this denouement: rather, a coercive gender apparatus overpowers a recognisably trans subject. The world of <i>Silence</i> is one in which, as trans thinker Andrea Long Chu writes, ‘you do not get to consent to yourself, even if you might deserve the chance’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn162_1" data-content=" 5   Andrea Long Chu, Females (London: Verso, 2019), p. 38."><sup>5</sup></a></p> <p> Mine is far from the first reading of <i>Silence</i> as a trans text.

Scholars have argued that, however the text concludes, it at least ‘affirm[s] the existence’ (Raskolnikov) of alternative medieval gender identifications, closes with generative ‘ambiguity’ (Watt), or ‘destabilizes the nature and function of gender in romance’ (Weisl): these rehabilitative readings cannot restore Silence’s agency, nor can they console trans people who have suffered under similar attempts to enforce distinctions between ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ behaviour.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn164_1" data-content=" 7   Raskolnikov, ‘Without Magic or Miracle’, p. 199; Watt, ‘Trans Heroism’, p. 173; Weisl, ‘How to Be a Man’, p. 133."><sup>7</sup></a> I am dissatisfied, too, with earlier feminist criticism that locates in <i>Silence</i> liberatory options for its supposedly female protagonist, given Silence’s vehement assertion that ‘valles sui et nient mescine’ (‘I’m a young man, and not a girl’, 2650).<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn165_1" data-content=" 8   Barbara Newman, ‘Did Goddesses Empower Women?

I want to ‘stay with the trouble’ of the text, with the bitter affects it continues to provoke in modern trans readers, embattled now, as Silence was then, by cis-normativity’s coercions and compulsions. I want to see what frustrations, what sorrows, and what intertemporal solidarities in trans struggle, that stubborn abiding might yield.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn166_1" data-content=" 9   I invoke Donna Haraway’s invitation to disruptive dwellings-with here: Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2016)."><sup>9</sup></a></p> <div class="NLM_sec NLM_sec_level_1"> <a name="_i2"><!-- title --></a><div class="sectionInfo"><div class="sectionHeading">‘U jo sui nus’: Silence’s transgender volition</div><div class="sectionJumpTo"></div></div> <p> To conceptualise Silence as a trans subject, we must first explore how Silence wants to conceive of <i>himself</i>.

Silence never expresses sexual wants: he is horrified by Eufeme’s lust, and submits to the king’s ‘plaisir’ without once voicing his own. Some scholars read him as completely asexual.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn169_1" data-content=" 12   Kathleen Blumreich, ‘Lesbian Desire in the Old French Roman de Silence’, Arthuriana, 7.2 (1997), 47–62 (p. 47); Jane Tolmie, ‘Silence in the Sewing Chamber: Le Roman de Silence’, French Studies, 63.1 (2009), 14–26 (p. 21)."><sup>12</sup></a> But asexuality does not equate to apathy, and critics who claims that Silence displays no will to ‘create an identity of her own’ (Lurkhur) or lacks desires beyond an ‘aspir[ation] to inherit her father’s patrimony’ (Berry) overlook key moments where he asserts a masculine identification.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn170_1" data-content=" 13   Lurkhur, ‘Medieval Silence’, p. 233; Craig Berry, ‘What Silence Desires: Female Inheritance and the Romance of Property in the Roman de Silence’, in Translating Desire in Medieval and Early Modern Literature, ed. by Berry and Heather Richardson Hayton (Tempe: Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 191–206 (p. 194)."><sup>13</sup></a></p> <p> In Silence’s early education, he is largely left to his own devices. ‘A il lassor assés’ (‘he was generally let alone’, 2491) in the forest: his self-discipline is such that his guardian sees no need to ‘destraindre’ (‘control’, 2486) him. Removed from enforced behavioural norms, he thrives: by his twelfth year, ‘n’i a un seul de lui plus maistre’ (‘none could master him’, 2493). Strikingly, in this freedom — this ‘state of nature’ — Silence does not veer from the masculine habits with which he was reared. Indeed, he continues to excel at them:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Quant il joent a le palaistre,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">A bohorder, n’a l’escremir,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Il seus fait tols ses pers fremir.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(When they play-wrestled, jousted or fenced, he alone had all his peers trembling.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(2494–96)</span> </div> <p> This remains true even after his father explains to him that ‘il est mescine’ (‘he’s a girl’, 2440). When Silence directs his own time, he actively chooses to cultivate masculine pursuits. Admittedly, there are flickers of uncertainty regarding his enjoyment of this lifestyle: he ‘forment s’enaprist’ (‘was much irked’) by his conscience’s warnings that his cross-gender habits constitute ‘couverture’ (‘deception’) (2497–99). But the Old French betrays complex feelings at play here. ‘S’enaprist’, which Roche-Mahdi’s much-cited translation renders as ‘was disturbed’, can also connote ‘making hard’, ‘goading on’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn171_1" data-content=" 14   enasprir,v.trans. 1 and 2, Anglo-Norman Dictionary (London: MHRA, 1997–) &lt;https://anglo-norman.net/entry/enasprir&gt; [accessed 14 January 2023]."><sup>14</sup></a> An alternative reading, then, sees Silence effortfully stimulating himself to abhor the gender-nonconformity that his society — and personified Nature — condemns, resisting his ‘us d’ome’ (‘men’s habits’, 2475) out of a learned sense of their aberrance. Moreover, Silence’s vexations seemingly stem not from a yen towards womanhood, but rather the inverse: a dysphoric frustration with the discrepancy between his boyish habits and the adolescent body he is growing into. When, during the ensuing Nature/Nurture debate, Silence is initially persuaded to live in accordance with his assigned gender, he is less anxious about missing out on girlhood than about his changing body setting him apart from male peers:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">quant jo m’afule</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Por moi de tel giu a retraire</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Com vallet suelent encor faire,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Dont dient tuit mi compagnon:</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">‘Cis avra moult le cuer felon’</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">[…]</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Mais ne sevent com moi estait.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(when I get dressed to pull myself out of the sorts of games boys usually play, then all my companions say, ‘This one will grow up to have a villain’s heart’.

He responds to Nature’s assertion that ‘tu nen es pas Scilentius!’ (‘you’re not Silentius!’, 2530) with baffled indignation:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">qui sui jo donques?</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Silencius ai non, jo cui,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">U jo sui altres que ne fui.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Mais cho sai jo bien, par ma destre,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Que jo ne puis pas altres estre!</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Donques sui jo Scilentius,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Cho m’est avis, u jo sui nus.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(Who am I then?

Thus, I am Silentius — so I reckon — or I am nothing/I am naked.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(2532–38)</span> </div> <p> Silence cannot conceptualise himself outside of his masculine identity: to deny his claim to being Silentius is to negate him utterly. After Nurture’s and Reason’s visitations, he reasserts his commitment to masculinity. Why would he be a woman, he wonders, when being a boy makes him feel so good: ‘Or sui jo moult vallans et pros’ (‘Now I’m so strong and valiant’, 2642)? This is not simply a comment on men’s privilege in Silence’s patriarchal society, but a positive self-evaluation, an expression of what Silence sees in himself when living as a man. Though he recoils from his pride in the next line (‘nel sui, par foi’ (‘no I’m not, in faith’), 2643), Silence’s delight in his boyish strength and bravery testifies to the empowering potential of his masculine gender performance.</p> <p> Silence’s commitment to masculinity does, occasionally, waver. After the debate, he experiences ‘diverse cogitatiön’ (‘fluctuating thoughts’, 2663), as might be expected from one ‘ki doit a tel usage entendre’ (‘who had to get accustomed to such habits’, 2665). Again, Roche-Mahdi’s translation of this line (‘who had to force himself to live that way’) may be misleading. ‘Entendre’ can mean to submit to or obey, but can also denote ‘to understand, be attentive to, listen to’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn173_1" data-content=" 16   entendre,v.intrans. 1, AND &lt;https://anglo-norman.net/entry/entendre_1&gt; [accessed 14 January 2023]."><sup>16</sup></a> This could, then, represent a period in which Silence considers, and comes to deeper understanding of, his masculine upbringing and habits — a natural process for a gender-nonconforming adolescent. That process continues as he gains independence, leaving home disguised as a minstrel. This choice, too, demonstrates a will towards self-determination. The itinerancy of a jongleur’s life, Barr notes, prevents them from being ‘conscripted’ into any one social system’s norms, and, per Cordula Kropik, music’s status as an art practiced by both men and women offers possibilities for a gender-neutral existence.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn174_1" data-content=" 17   Barr, ‘Idea of the Wilderness’, p. 7; Cordula Kropik, ‘Schweigen im Walde.

Trans people, accustomed to fighting for survival in a hostile world, might well recognise in Silence’s decision a tactical escape from threatened coercion into cis-normativity.</p> <p> As a minstrel, Silence renames himself ‘Malduit’, ‘car il se tient moult por mal duit’ (‘because he considered himself very badly raised’, 3178). For Simon Gaunt, this assumed name represents Silence’s ‘recogn[ition of] her femininity’ and bitterness at being raised male.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn176_1" data-content=" 19   Simon Gaunt, ‘The Significance of Silence’, Paragraph, 13.2 (1990), 202–16 (p. 208)."><sup>19</sup></a> But we could also read it as a punning reassertion of masculinity: as Michèle Perret notes, Silence switches a gender-neutral name for an explicitly male-gendered one.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn177_1" data-content=" 20   Michèle Perret, ‘Travesties et Transsexuelles: Yde, Silence, Grisandole, Blanchandine’, Romance Notes, 25.3 (1985), 328–40 (p. 332)."><sup>20</sup></a> This undercuts the idea that he resents his imposed masculinity: since he is leaving in disguise, he could assume a female identity, but shows no interest in doing so. Moreover, the ‘mal’ of ‘Malduit’ is a homonym of ‘malle’, male: earlier, Silence’s external appearance is described as ‘trestolt malles’ (‘utterly male’, 2478).<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn178_1" data-content=" 21   Loren Ringer, ‘Exchange, Identity, and Transvestism in Le roman de Silence’, Dalhousie French Studies, 28 (1994), 3–13 (p. 8)."><sup>21</sup></a> <i>Malduit</i>’s polysemy hints at Silence’s sly awareness that his male upbringing is aberrant, ‘mal’ in society’s eyes, yet the name’s gendered ending also reiterates a commitment to that upbringing. This assertive renaming aligns Silence both with other male heroes of the French Arthurian verse tradition who discard old names and explore new identities outside the court’s confines while on quests, and with modern trans people, for whom self-naming often represents an important act of identity construction.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn179_1" data-content=" 22   Sarah Gordon, ‘The Man with No Name: Identity in French Arthurian Verse Romance’, Arthuriana, 18.2 (2008), 70–81."><sup>22</sup></a> In taking the name Malduit while escaping from the parents who carry the dangerous knowledge of his female sex, Silence engages boldly, playfully, with his transgender identification.</p> <p> Silence expresses that identification up until the text’s conclusion, taking active pleasure in it as a knight on the battlefield. Silence ‘ne se repent rien | De son usage, ains l’ainme bien’ (‘had no regrets about the habits he’d grown up with; indeed, he loved them’, 5177–78): far from bemoaning being ‘badly raised’, he delights in the masculine life he has grown into. True, he does not consistently voice his will towards masculine identification in such clear terms. But the desire flickers through the text, bursting out in these childhood and battlefield scenes, belying interpretations of Silence’s masculinity as purely pragmatic. In crediting Silence’s declaration that ‘valles sui et nient mescine’ (‘I’m a young man, and not a girl’, 2650), I am reading in line with his desires.</p> <p> We must also consider what Silence does <i>not</i> want — what identifications he might be struggling against, and why. Craig Berry notes that Silence often expresses his desire through negative statements:<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn180_1" data-content=" 23   Berry, ‘What Silence Desires’, p. 194."><sup>23</sup></a> after the first Nature/Nurture debate, for instance, he declares,</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ne voel perdre ma grant honor,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ne la voel cangier a menor.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ne voel mon pere desmentir.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(I don’t want to lose the great esteem I’ve gained; I don’t want to exchange it for anything less, and I don’t want to discredit my father.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(2651–53)</span> </div> <p> But the fate Silence rejects most fervently is that of sexual subjugation, which he characterises as a specifically female experience. His speech following the debate is full of sexual anxieties. ‘Deseure sui, s’irai desos?’ (‘I’m on top: should I drop to the bottom?’, 2641), he asks, voicing antipathy towards playing a subordinate role in both society and sex. His clinching motivation in deciding to live as a boy is fear of what he might experience in the ‘giu c’on fait desos gordine’ (‘game people play under the covers’, 2649) as a woman. He claims his body is unsuited to sexual intimacy: ‘Trop dure boche ai por baisier, | Et trop rois bras por acoler’ (‘I have a mouth too hard for kissing, and arms too rough for embracing’, 2646–47). His earlier assertive self-identification (‘sui jo Scilentius, | […] u jo sui nus’, 2537–38) punningly suggests dread of bodily exposure: ‘jo sui nus’ translates to both ‘I am no one’ <i>and</i> ‘I am naked’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn181_1" data-content=" 24   I believe Perret first noted this (‘Travestites et Transsexuelles’, p. 332)."><sup>24</sup></a> To be a woman — to be Silentia — means, for Silence, to be exposed to the force of others’ desires. This implication is also present in Silence’s parents’ language. Proposing to raise Silence as a boy, Cador says that, if they later have a son, they will simply ‘cesti ferons desvaleter’ (‘de-boy this one’, 2047). The coinage ‘desvaleter’ is modelled on ‘despuceler’, meaning to ‘de-maiden’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn182_1" data-content=" 25   Perret, ‘Travesties et Transsexuelles’, p. 336."><sup>25</sup></a> The prospect of turning Silence back into a girl thus bears overtones of sexual violation: being ‘de-boyed’ makes him vulnerable to being ‘deflowered’.</p> <p> <i>Silence</i> — alongside other texts of the manuscript in which it is copied — bears out this anxiety in its female characters’ fates. The violence of Queen Eufeme’s attempt to seduce Silence resonates with discussions of women coercing men in Section 2 of this volume: she clutches at him with the animal, predatory force of ‘li ostoirs qui joint a l’anne’ (‘a hawk attacking a duck’, 3863).<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn183_1" data-content=" 26   Excepting Blumreich, who describes Silence ‘barely avoid[ing] being raped’ by Eufeme (‘Lesbian Desire’, p. 53), strikingly few critics have characterised Eufeme’s assault on Silence as such."><sup>26</sup></a> Before this, however, she is co-opted into a marriage for which her consent is not sought, and within which it is systematically disregarded. Eufeme is shipped from Norway to become King Ebain’s wife as part of a peace agreement. Transported with animal chattel, and, like them, subject to his ‘saisine’ (a legal term denoting possession, 187), it is unsurprising that her heart is ‘un poi amer’ (‘a little bitter’, 245) in her new home. Her queendom stems from her status as a ‘war trophy’ traded between men.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn184_1" data-content=" 27   Heather Tanner, ‘Lords, Wives, and Vassals in the Roman de Silence’, Journal of Women’s History, 24.1 (2012), 138–59 (p. 151)."><sup>27</sup></a> She subjects Silence to the sexual coercion to which she has herself been subjected, specifically paralleling situations in medieval Irish literature discussed by Emmet Taylor in Chapter 7. And while the text condemns her subsequent attempt to defame Silence by falsely accusing him of rape, there is equal horror in Ebain’s response to the allegation. When Eufeme demands Silence’s punishment, Ebain, electing to preserve his homosocial bond with Silence over his wife’s apparent anguish, lies about having committed Silence to death. His attempt to pacify her features one of <i>Silence</i>’s grimmest and most revealing statements on consent and agency: ‘on doit moult faire | Solvent contre sa volenté’ (‘one must do many things that contravene one’s desires’, 4232–33). Addressing a woman he believes is a rape victim, Ebain presents male coercion as an inevitability to which Eufeme must resign herself. As Jane Tolmie notes, one of the most ‘convincing proofs’ of Silence’s successful performance of masculinity is the assumption that he ‘can participate in sexual violence’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn185_1" data-content=" 28   Tolmie, ‘Silence in the Sewing Chamber’, p. 23."><sup>28</sup></a> In <i>Silence</i>’s world, men overriding women’s consent simply represents the ‘natural’ state of gender relations.</p> <p> Silence’s mother Eufemie’s marriage, too, is grounded on highly contingent consent. Eufemie’s union with Cador seemingly springs from intense mutual affection: describing their intimacy, the narrator comments, ‘se plus i a a volenté | Tant croist l’Amor plus a plenté’ (‘the more there’s mutual desire between them, the more love grows’, 751–52). That intimacy is facilitated by King Ebain having promised both Cador and Eufemie their free choice of spouses. But, as Sharon Kinoshita observes, this apparently consensual love-plot conceals a political reality preoccupied with the ‘feudal politics of lineage’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn186_1" data-content=" 29   Sharon Kinoshita, ‘Heldris de Cornuälle’s Roman de Silence and the Feudal Politics of Lineage’, PMLA,110.3 (1995), 397–409 (pp. 398–402)."><sup>29</sup></a> Behind the scenes, King Ebain’s ‘volenté’ takes precedence, reflecting the real-life prioritisation of familial and patriarchal consent discussed by Mara Schmueckle in Chapter 11. Ebain declares, ‘Jo voel que Cador ait | Iceste mescine entresait’ (‘I want Cador to have this girl straightaway’, 1275–76). Whatever Ebain has promised Eufemie, it is ultimately Cador who will ‘have’ possession of the ‘girl’, who remains unnamed throughout the king’s speech. Though their marriage appears happy, it also reflects the monarch’s preserve to bestow women upon courtiers at will — or, as his marriage to Silence shows, to take the choicest ones for himself.</p> <p> The circumscribed consent of <i>Silence</i>’s women echoes other texts included in Nottingham University Library MS WL/LM/6, the <i>roman</i>’s sole surviving manuscript.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn187_1" data-content=" 30   For a catalogue of the manuscript’s contents, see Inci Bozkaya, ‘Illuminiertes Schweigen.

The force of her claims is overpowering: she succeeds in briefly persuading Silence to embrace his ‘natural’ femininity.</p> <p> That force characterises Nature’s actions throughout <i>Silence</i>. Nature imposes her will on her creations with a unique belligerence that differentiates her from her allegorical foil, Nurture. The language used to describe Silence’s creation implies oppressive strength:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Nature qui moult grant force a</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Vint a l’enfant, si s’esforça.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Dist: ‘Or voel faire ouvre forcible’.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(Nature, who has great strength, came to the child and set to it, saying, ‘Now I’ll create a mighty piece of work’.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(1805–07)</span> </div> <p> The threefold repetition of ‘force’-words stresses her potent grip on Silence. Strikingly, Heldris uses similar ‘force’ language to describe sexual coercion. Eufeme says that she could have Silence skinned alive, ‘ki si me volsis efforcier’ (‘because you wanted to rape me here’, 4092); later, Silence explains that Eufeme falsely accused him of trying to ‘le […] a force amer’ (‘fuck her forcibly’, 6611). In a scene of actual sexual violence — Eufeme’s aggressive attempted seduction — Nature’s ‘force’ is again aligned with physical coercion. When Silence says he cannot sleep with Eufeme, she replies,</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Estes vus donc pris ne loiés?</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">[…] Qui vos cache?</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ki vus laidist?

Silence <i>is</i> ‘bound’ to someone: only two lines before, his ‘nature’ has refused to ‘consent’ to Eufeme’s advances. While he is in Nature’s clutches, Silence’s meaningful consent is impossible. The strength of Nature’s desires — that he honour his female sex, avoid ‘unnatural’ sex with Eufeme, submit to heterosexual marriage to Ebain — always triumphs over attempts at struggle.</p> <p> The oppressive weight of <i>Silence</i>’s cis- and hetero-normative society’s ‘desires’, embodied in Nature, may seem bleakly familiar to modern trans and gender-nonconforming readers. We, too, often feel ‘bound’ by obligations to stick to scripts of normative gender performance, experience ‘consent[ing] to [our]sel[ves]’ as a cruel impossibility. Queer and feminist theorists have long analysed gender as a coercive apparatus.

Developing earlier work by chiefly cisgender feminist thinkers about gender constraints, Chu proposes ‘femaleness’ as a universal condition, admitting no distinctions between the genders we claim for ourselves — men, women, and nonbinary people, Chu insists, are all functionally ‘female’. Our shared ‘femaleness’ is defined by subjection to others’ desires, ‘real or imagined, concentrated or diffuse’, a definition that recalls <i>Silence</i>’s grim depictions of womanhood.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn198_1" data-content=" 41   Chu, Females,p. 11."><sup>41</sup></a> For Chu, gender is externally imposed — ‘you are not the central transit hub for meaning about yourself’ — and revolves around others’ ‘wants’, over which the individual lacks control.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn199_1" data-content=" 42   Chu, Females,p. 38."><sup>42</sup></a> Self-identification is ‘worthless’ without society’s consent to that identification — a consent often denied to trans and other gender-deviant subjects.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn200_1" data-content=" 43   Chu, Females,p. 38."><sup>43</sup></a> Chu’s argument is provocative, pessimistic, near-nihilistic. Like Ebain addressing his wife after she tells him she has been raped, it insists that we must ‘do many things that contravene [our] desires’, and its contentions have generated considerable controversy. When examining <i>Silence</i>’s ending, however, it is hard not to feel its aptness — especially considering the fates assigned to the text’s gender-nonconforming characters.</p> <p> Silence is not alone in being subjected to Nature’s regulatory desires. Ultimately, every character who violates sexual or gender norms is brutally punished. <i>Silence</i>’s denouement is initiated by an encounter with Merlin, the legendary wizard-turned-wild-man who can only be captured by an ‘engien de feme’ (‘woman’s trick’, 5803). Silence’s success in trapping him therefore leads to the revelation of Silence’s female sex. Merlin is lured by smelling cooked meat, after long having followed a vegetarian diet. This trap represents the triumph of Merlin’s ‘true’, civilised nature, following the final Nature/Nurture debate.

Instead, Merlin’s volition is emphasised: he approaches the fire, considers the meat until it was done ‘si sen vint’ (‘to his liking’), and eats with relish, smacking his lips like one ‘moult […] familleus’ (‘starved’).<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn202_1" data-content=" 45   The Vulgate Version of the Arthurian Romances, vol. 2: Lestoire de Merlin,ed. by H.

We could read Heldris’s adaptation, with its emphasis on Merlin’s overpowering, ‘natural’ appetites, as comic. But the consonance between Nature’s physical coercion and the language used to describe her dominance over Silence undercut a purely humorous reading — especially when we take into account Merlin’s gender deviance.</p> <p> <i>Silence</i>’s Merlin is hardly a traditional masculine subject. His life in the woods is far removed from the court in which gender is ritualised and policed, and, as Stock notes, he is uninterested in ‘expected cultural signifiers of masculinity’: ‘martial puissance, sexual virility, [and] potency’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn203_1" data-content=" 46   Stock, ‘Being Gender “Stable”’, p. 26."><sup>46</sup></a> In the wider contemporary Arthurian tradition, with which Heldris was probably familiar, he likewise resists binary gendering.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn204_1" data-content=" 47   Miranda Griffin discusses Merlin’s genderqueer entanglements with women like Niviene/Niniane across Old French romances (Transforming Tales: Rewriting Metamorphosis in Medieval French Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), pp. 182, 199–208); Jes Battis offers queer readings of the Merlin figure in medieval romance and modern medievalist re-imaginings (Thinking Queerly: Medievalism, Wizardry, and Neurodiversity in Young Adult Texts (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2021), pp. 27–58)."><sup>47</sup></a> The Merlin-figure’s genderqueer inflections give Nature’s desire to bring him to heel extra charge. As with Silence, she seeks to drag a boundary-blurring deviant back to court and control his desires; as with Silence, she ultimately succeeds. After his capture, Merlin is subjected to hundreds of probing eyes ‘garder a mervelle’ (‘staring in wonder’, 6182) at this vegetarian freak of the forest, beaten, threatened with execution, and compelled to explain his irrepressible laughter, with disastrous consequences for <i>Silence</i>’s other gender-nonconformists. As Robert Sturges notes, Merlin is apparently never liberated from the court’s grip: our final glimpse of him sees him ‘fermement tenir’ (‘securely held’, 6569) on Ebain’s orders.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn205_1" data-content=" 48   Robert Sturges, ‘Animal, Merlin, Demon’, in Beasts, Humans, and Transhumans in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, ed. by J.

Eufeme is next. Merlin reveals that she has been cuckolding Ebain with a nun in her entourage, assigned male at birth but living in ‘dras de feme’ (‘women’s clothes’, 6532). Eufeme is promptly ‘a chevals detraite’ (‘torn apart by horses’, 6656), her brutal punishment dispatched in a single line. Eufeme’s crimes against court norms are not limited to infidelity. Throughout <i>Silence</i>, she exhibits queer desires: she first lusts after a ‘girl’ dressed as a boy (Silence), then after a ‘man’ dressed as a woman (the nun). Her excessive, unruly desire is concentrated on figures who occupy unstable positions within the gender binary. This renders her not only a deviant wife, but a deviant <i>woman</i>: as Kathleen Blumreich writes, Eufeme’s ‘greatest sin’ is her ‘lack of normal feminine desire’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn206_1" data-content=" 49   Blumreich, ‘Lesbian Desire’, p. 53."><sup>49</sup></a> Thus, she must be punished and purged from the court. Her transfeminine lover, who, like Silence, is generally referred to using pronouns that reflect her gender performance rather than her sex, is also subjected to bodily exposure and a one-line execution (‘i fu la none donc deffaite’ (‘then the nun was killed’, 6655)). The causative phrasing of the nun’s stripping — Ebain ‘fait avant venir | La nonain, sil fait despollier’ (‘had the nun brought forward to be stripped’, 6570–71) — obscures the question of who, exactly, does the disrobing, who lays hands on this gender-nonconforming body. Unlike Merlin, Eufeme, and Silence, the nun is a marginal figure: she never appears before the text’s conclusion, and receives only two lines of dialogue (6250–51). But such a minor character also falling victim to humiliation and punishment at Ebain’s hands demonstrates the totality, the unassailability, of <i>Silence</i>’s regime of cis-normative gender coercion. Any aberrations must be brought into line with the ‘natural’ order — or excised from the narrative in one swift stroke.</p> <p> Silence is no exception. Merlin reveals that ‘si est desos les dras meschine. | La vesteüre, ele est de malle’ (‘he is a girl under those clothes. The attire, yes, that’s masculine’, 6536–37), reducing Silence’s cultivated gender performance to a matter of clothing. Like the nun, Silence is stripped, made ‘nus’, just as he previously feared. Naked before the court, his manhood falls away: Ebain, having ‘tolt issi l’a trové par tolt’ (‘found everything present and correct’, 6574), publicly affirms that ‘nos veöns bien que tu iés feme’ (‘we clearly see you’re a woman’, 6586). Silence is then forced to explain himself. There is no indication that he is allowed to dress again before speaking. The <i>roman</i> thus ends with a transgender subject compelled, first, to expose his long-concealed sex, then, naked, to account for his deviant gender performance. It is worth lingering on this moment’s cruelty. Trans people today continue to be subjected to similar scopophilic violence, stemming from cisgender viewers’ desires for titillation, or for ‘proof’ of the trans body’s ‘true’ nature<i>.</i><a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn207_1" data-content=" 50   See Lehr’s comparison of this scene to the forcible stripping of Brandon Teena preceding his transphobic murder in the 1999 film Boys Don’t Cry (‘“Everything in its Proper Place”’, p. 38)."><sup>50</sup></a> Perhaps the only dignity Silence is afforded here stems from the avoidance of overt description of the ‘tolt […] par tolt’ that Ebain finds in his nakedness. The narrator skims over the facts of Silence’s body, leaving readers without a clear picture. I am reminded of a moment in Jordy Rosenberg’s 2018 novel <i>Confessions of the Fox</i>: while editing the writings of an eighteenth-century transmasculine thief, a trans academic undermines his publisher’s insistence that ‘READERS NEED TO […] VISUALIZE’ the thief’s ‘chimeric’ genitalia by supplying a marbled page instead of the requested ‘picture’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn208_1" data-content=" 51   Jordy Rosenberg, Confessions of the Fox (New York: One World, 2018), p. 132."><sup>51</sup></a> The images discussed by Bettina Bildhauer in Chapter 6 of this volume also obscure their representations of genitalia at moments of purported exposure. Sometimes, when faced with cis-normative society’s coercions and compulsions, the only resistance available to trans people lies in diverting or baffling the cisgender gaze.</p> <p> Silence’s ordeal is not yet over, however. Once he has explained himself and submitted to Ebain’s ‘plaisir’, Nature imposes her will on his body one last time:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">D’illuec al tierc jor que Nature</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ot recovree sa droiture</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Si prist Nature a repolir</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Par tolt le cors et a tolir</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Tolt quanque ot sor le cors de malle.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(On the third day, once Nature had recovered her rightful possession, she seized Silence, re-burnishing and smoothing his whole body, removing every corporeal trace of masculinity.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(6669–73)</span> </div> <p> The language is intensely physical: ‘prendre’ and ‘tolir’ both denote seizing, grasping, and can denote sexually ‘taking’ someone by force.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn209_1" data-content=" 52   prendre,v.trans. 1, AND &lt;https://anglo-norman.net/entry/prendre_1&gt;; tolir,v.trans.4 &lt;https://anglo-norman.net/entry/tolir&gt; [accessed 17 January 2023]."><sup>52</sup></a> Silence is thoroughly, wordlessly feminised by Nature, rendered a picture of girlish beauty, his complexion restored to ‘rose al lis’ (‘rose and lily’, 6675).

We are dealing with the will of a king, aligned with the will of a goddess, set against that of a transgender subject who, having been ‘corrected’ by Nature, can only wordlessly conform to the expectations set by his name.

After reading a story of a hero whose only expressed desires tend towards masculine identification being relentlessly coerced into womanhood, Heldris’s concluding lines seemed cruelly ironic: ‘a cials, a celes qui l’oïrent | Otroit Jhesus cho qu’il desirent’ (‘to those — men and women — who listened to it, may Jesus grant them all they desire’, 6705–06). Who, in <i>Silence</i>, gets their ‘desire’? Perhaps Ebain, who swaps out his unfaithful, perversely lustful queen for a younger, quieter model, but certainly not <i>Silence</i>’s protagonist — nor any of its other gender deviants. This narrative ultimately turns on the thwarting of transgender volition, and the triumph of structures of cis-normative gendering.</p> <p> What do we make of <i>Silence</i>’s grinding negativity, particularly when reading from a trans perspective? Much earlier feminist criticism — which usually read Silence as ‘grounded as female’ — revolved around the ‘impossible question’ of whether <i>Silence</i> was ‘ultimately misogynist or philogynous’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn213_1" data-content=" 56   Krueger, Women Readers, p. 120; Regina Psaki, ‘Introduction’, Arthuriana,7.2 (1997), 3–6 (p. 6)."><sup>56</sup></a> Scholars strove to divine ‘proto-feminis[m]’ or fundamental ‘conservati[sm]’ in Heldris’s intentions.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn214_1" data-content=" 57   Psaki, ‘Introduction’, Le Roman de Silence, trans. by Psaki (New York: Garland, 1991), pp. ix–xxxviii (p. xxx); Kinoshita, ‘Male-Order Brides’, p. 64."><sup>57</sup></a> Some even wondered whether this otherwise unknown author was a woman.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn215_1" data-content=" 58   On this debate, see Kristin Burr, ‘Nurturing Debate in Le Roman de Silence’, in Founding Feminisms in Medieval Studies: Essays in Honor of E. Jane Burns, ed. by Laine Doggett and Daniel O’Sullivan (Cambridge: Brewer, 2016), pp. 33–44 (p. 33)."><sup>58</sup></a> Roberta Krueger offered a useful solution to this deadlock. Acknowledging the ultimate indecipherability of Heldris’s intentions, she instead asked what critical possibilities female readers could recoup from <i>Silence</i>’s articulation of gender-as-‘repressive political matrix’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn216_1" data-content=" 59   Krueger, Women Readers, p. 112."><sup>59</sup></a> I am reminded here of Chapter 4 in this volume, in which Basil Arnould Price explores the ways in which attempts to read <i>Svarfdæla saga</i> as straightforwardly misogynistic fall down when confronting the unremitting grimness of Yngvildr’s fate — forcing a turn towards Halberstam’s antisocial feminism, which emphasises expressions of agency that are not necessarily legible from positivist feminist perspectives. I model my trans reading after Krueger’s feminist one, and present it in dialogue with the following chapter: I am less interested in asking whether <i>Silence</i> is an inherently transphobic text, than I am in exploring what the narrative might offer to trans readers, in spite, or perhaps <i>because</i>, of its bleakness.</p> <p> That bleakness cannot be argued away. Possibilities illuminated by Silence’s gender-nonconformity are all foreclosed by the text’s conclusion. Over almost seven thousand lines, coercion repeatedly proves unavoidable, and consent impossible, except for the most powerful. In this, <i>Silence</i> surprisingly resembles Chu’s <i>Females</i>. Though written centuries apart, both texts articulate bleak outlooks on self-identification; both prove hard to pin down in their intentions. Cis and trans readers criticised <i>Females</i>’ perceived hyperbolic negativity, its ‘rhetorical stink bomb[s]’, its ‘unsparing’ argument, its privileging of affect over politics.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn217_1" data-content=" 60   Kay Gabriel, ‘The Limits of the Bit’, Los Angeles Review of Books, 25 November 2019 &lt;https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-limits-of-the-bit/&gt; [accessed 16 January 2023]; Jules Joanne Gleeson, ‘Are Jokes Going to Cut It? Concerning Andrea Long Chu’s Females’, TSQ,7.3 (2020), 332–44 (p. 332). Females has also been legitimately criticised for its failure to engage with black feminist thinkers’ work on gender’s coercions: see Gleeson, ‘Are Jokes Going to Cut It?’, p. 337, and Gabriel, ‘The Limits of the Bit’."><sup>60</sup></a> Yet that very affective intensity is Chu’s point. When Chu declares that ‘everyone is female, and everyone hates it’, she is not, I think, making an unassailable truth claim, but rather illuminating what it is to <i>feel</i> that statement as true: to feel gendered expectations closing around you like a vice, to feel utterly estranged from your own desires and capacity to consent.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn218_1" data-content=" 61   Chu, Females,p. 11."><sup>61</sup></a></p> <p> Likewise, I do not think <i>Silence</i> aims to articulate a cogent theory of gender: as Katherine Terrell notes, its ‘contradictions’ are too numerous, its logics too twisting.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn219_1" data-content=" 62   Terrell, ‘Competing Gender Ideologies’, p. 36."><sup>62</sup></a> Nor does it posit as incontestable the idea that Silence is destined to live as a woman, as Nature’s loss in the first debate indicates. Instead, it offers a window onto the everyday coercive violence of gender’s reproduction in a cis-normative world — and, through this, a potential, if not hopeful, glimpse of medieval trans subjectivity. It makes us feel the terror of Silence’s discovery, the violence of his stripping, the grief of his eventual muteness. Like Chu, Heldris illuminates an affect of gender pessimism, showing us what it is to live as a transgender subject in a world of circumscribed choices.</p> <p> As Hil Malatino argues, there is value in trans pessimism, in trans negativity, in asserting our ‘right to feel bad’ and making a commitment to ‘staying with a troubling […] coterie of bad feelings’ that bring home transphobia’s ‘existential impacts’.<a href="#" class="ref refx" data-id="fn220_1" data-content=" 63   Hil Malatino, Side Affects: On Being Trans and Feeling Bad (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2022), pp. 3, 7."><sup>63</sup></a> ‘Bad’ trans feelings can rouse us to fight for our lives in moments of urgency, or move us to offer each other empathy and care in the quieter moments that follow. Just as there is value in such negative affects, there is value in <i>Silence</i> for the modern trans reader. Trans existence was hard in the thirteenth century; it remains hard in the twenty-first. But it is nonetheless astonishing that this text survives to offer a voice of solidarity from within the binds of a cis-normative gender regime across vast stretches of time. In reading <i>Silence</i>, we might experience a compassionate grief that solidifies our intertemporal ties to the trans people who have preceded us, or feel a fury at how little has changed that may come to mind next time we are driven onto the streets. Such feelings are neither positive nor easy, but they nonetheless demand our attention. As Silence says in his last speech, using the text’s final iteration of <i>consentir</i>:</p> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">La vertés nel puet consentir</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Que jo vos puissce rien mentir,</div> <div class="NLM_verse-line">Ne jo n’ai soig mais de saisir.</div> <div class="NLM_verse-group"> <div class="NLM_verse-line">(Truth won’t consent to my deceiving you in any way, nor do I care to stay silent any more.)</div> </div> <span class="NLM_attrib">(6625–27)</span> </div> </div>
