<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">M</span><span style="color:#000000;">edieval romances contain few obvious narrative challenges to </span><span style="color:#000000;">the </span><span style="color:#000000;">status of the body as the origin of gender: in fiction, as in other cultural</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">discourses, gender identity and social roles are defined by sexual charac­</span><span style="color:#000000;">teristics inscribed on the body at birth. There is, however, a group of narratives </span><span style="color:#000000;">in the romance corpus that calls into question the simple equation of body </span><span style="color:#000000;">and gender. Transvestite romances, stories of women who dress and act as </span><span style="color:#000000;">men, directly challenge the primacy of the body in determining gender. These </span><span style="color:#000000;">narratives suggest that gender is not essential but performative, that the </span><span style="color:#000000;">enactment of a gender through performance and dress may have an authority </span><span style="color:#000000;">equal to that of anatomical characteristics in determining gender identity.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Transvestite romances question the nature of sexual difference by valorizing </span><span style="color:#000000;">the role of performance in gender identification. In their relocation of gender </span><span style="color:#000000;">identity from the body to a performance they represent the possibility of an </span><span style="color:#000000;">ambiguously gendered being whose convincing performance as a man is </span><span style="color:#000000;">contradicted by anatomical features classified as female. The crossdressed </span><span style="color:#000000;">heroine disrupts gender categorizations that are based on a reading of anatomy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and suggests that all gender roles are performative, that any render identity </span><span style="color:#000000;">is fabricated through corporeal signs and through discourse.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">The medieval transvestite romance presents a profoundly troubling spec­</span><span style="color:#000000;">tacle to an aristocratic society founded and maintained by dynastic marriage </span><span style="color:#000000;">and succession because ambiguous gender threatens the disruption of dynastic </span><span style="color:#000000;">structures—a woman dressed as a man cannot engender a child. The anxiety </span><span style="color:#000000;">provoked by the transvestite heroine must be contained in these romances </span><span style="color:#000000;">through a restoration of "proper" channels of reproduction and succession. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Yet although body and performance are realigned once the discrepancy be­</span><span style="color:#000000;">tween them is discovered, the realignment does not always conform to a </span><span style="color:#000000;">"natural" gender dictated by the body. In a few narratives the disjunction </span><span style="color:#000000;">between the gendered body and the gender performance is convincing enough </span><span style="color:#000000;">to require a miraculous regendering of the body to conform to its dress. In </span><span style="color:#000000;">another romance, the thirteenth-century </span><span style="color:#000000;">''Roman de Silence, ''</span><span style="color:#000000;">a cross-dressed </span><span style="color:#000000;">heroine's appropriation of a masculine identity is successful enough to subvert </span><span style="color:#000000;">her assumption of a female identity at the end of the story.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:2.54cm;margin-right:0.127cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Transvestite romances recount the process of bringing the body and per­</span><span style="color:#000000;">formance into line according to a cultural imperative grounded in and main­tained by marital alliances and dynastic succession. Yet in the initial disjunc­</span><span style="color:#000000;">tion they set forth between the gendered body and a performance of gender, </span><span style="color:#000000;">and in the importance they give to performance in the identification of gender, </span><span style="color:#000000;">transvestite romances reveal the constructed nature of the gendered subjec­</span><span style="color:#000000;">tivity of all romance characters. They suggest that the idea of a "natural" </span><span style="color:#000000;">sexual difference indicated on the body is part of the ideology that supports </span><span style="color:#000000;">the founding institutions of medieval aristocratic society: marriage and suc­</span><span style="color:#000000;">cession.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:2.54cm;margin-right:0.127cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Scholars from a variety of disciplines have begun to question the commonly </span><span style="color:#000000;">invoked distinction between sex, a biological identity, and gender, a social </span><span style="color:#000000;">identity. Biologists, for example, have used studies of children born with </span><span style="color:#000000;">ambiguous genitalia to show the importance of socialization in determining </span><span style="color:#000000;">both sex and gender.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>2</sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"> Even in cases of children with clearly defined sexual </span><span style="color:#000000;">characteristics, biological and social identifications may reinforce each other, </span><span style="color:#000000;">obscuring origins while reinforcing cultural definitions of male and female:</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:3.429cm;margin-right:1.016cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">If a society puts half its children in skirts and warns them not to </span><span style="color:#000000;">move in ways that reveal their underpants, while putting the other </span><span style="color:#000000;">half in jeans or overalls and encouraging them to climb trees and </span><span style="color:#000000;">play strenuous outdoor games; if later, during adolescence, the </span><span style="color:#000000;">half that has been in trousers is exhorted to "eat like a growing boy," while the half in skirts is warned to watch their figure and </span><span style="color:#000000;">not get fat; if the half in jeans trots around in sneakers or boots, </span><span style="color:#000000;">while the half in skirts totters around on spike heels, then these </span><span style="color:#000000;">two groups of people will differ biologically as well as socially. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Their muscles will be different, their reflexes, posture, arms, legs, </span><span style="color:#000000;">feet, their eye-hand coordination, spatial perception, and so on. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In other words, sex differences are socially constructed not only </span><span style="color:#000000;">in the sense that society defines sex-appropriate behaviors to which </span><span style="color:#000000;">each of us learns to conform, but also in the sense that those</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">The social prescription of gender identity, prompted by a reading of anatomi­</span><span style="color:#000000;">cal features, reshapes the body to heighten or even to create those features. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The process of acculturation follows a binary organization of male/female </span><span style="color:#000000;">which requires a coordination of genitalia and body and which excludes any </span><span style="color:#000000;">third term as "deviant," as a contradiction of a "natural" system.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>4</sup></span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Gender identity is the product of a system of classification that is itself already embedded in a larger symbolic system. Judith Butler has suggested </span><span style="color:#000000;">that since even the most "natural facts" of sex are produced in discourse and are therefore potentially influenced by political and social interests, perhaps "this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender ... the dis­tinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>5</sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"> The binary system of gender is authorized by particular social institutions that are in turn maintained and legitimized by the definition of sexual identity that </span><span style="color:#000000;">promotes difference between male and female, and that valorizes heterosexu­</span><span style="color:#000000;">ality. Cultural intelligibility is defined according to conformity with one sex or the other.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Theoreticians of modern gay and lesbian crossdressing practices have </span><span style="color:#000000;">claimed the third "deviant" term created by exclusion from a dual-category </span><span style="color:#000000;">system of </span><span style="color:#000000;">gender as a privileged site from which to expose the ideological </span><span style="color:#000000;">forces that maintain and enforce the opposition male/female. As a </span><span style="color:#000000;">practice </span><span style="color:#000000;">situated outside the binary framework of sexual difference, transvestism </span><span style="color:#000000;">disrupts gender categories, undermines the authority of the body, and suggests </span><span style="color:#000000;">that gender is a performance. The transvestite's appearance clashes with forms </span><span style="color:#000000;">defined as intelligible by a restricted cultural system of gender, and embodies </span><span style="color:#000000;">the possibility that gender is not limited to an anatomical definition. In its disruption of gender categories, the crossdressed body poses the question of </span><span style="color:#000000;">who may identity gender and according to what criteria. To claim the authority </span><span style="color:#000000;">to reinterpret gender categories is a political act because it threatens the social </span><span style="color:#000000;">institutions that depend on a strictly defined opposition between male and </span><span style="color:#000000;">female. The need or imperative to identify gender according to a binary of male/female is no less politically motivated.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Medieval romances about transvestite heroines are profoundly implicated in the politics of gender identification.

<div style="margin-left:2.667cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">to challenge traditional definitions of social roles according to anatomy, at </span><span style="color:#000000;">the end of her/his story the crossdressed heroine is always integrated into an </span><span style="color:#000000;">aristocratic society whose stability is maintained through marriage and re­</span><span style="color:#000000;">production. The possibility that the transvestite figure may represent an </span><span style="color:#000000;">alternate gender is not admitted in medieval romance. Stories about cross-</span><span style="color:#000000;">dressing may question the location of gender identity, but they do not blur </span><span style="color:#000000;">gender categories. In the aristocratic society of medieval romances characters </span><span style="color:#000000;">who dress as men are perceived to be men, characters in women's dress are </span><span style="color:#000000;">taken for women. Gender may be hidden by disguise, but the disguise itself </span><span style="color:#000000;">is not recognized as an expression of ambiguous gender or as a performance </span><span style="color:#000000;">of an alternate gender that obscures or plays on the binary division of male/fe­</span><span style="color:#000000;">male. The gender disguise that might express a sexual orientation is also </span><span style="color:#000000;">foreign to medieval representations of crossdressing: the woman whose mas­culine dress might express a sexual desire for women is an unintelligible figure </span><span style="color:#000000;">in the world of medieval romance.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>6</sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"> While stories about crossdressed heroines </span><span style="color:#000000;">may gesture toward a representation of homoeroticism otherwise suppressed </span><span style="color:#000000;">in medieval narratives, in these romances crossdressing is always undertaken </span><span style="color:#000000;">for some pragmatic end, and crossdressed women are sexually abstinent.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>7</sup></span></div>

<div style="margin-left:2.667cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">The earliest medieval examples of transvestite narratives are hagiographic </span><span style="color:#000000;">accounts of female saints who dressed as men in order to escape a marriage </span><span style="color:#000000;">or join a religious community.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>8</sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"> The saint's female body is discovered only </span><span style="color:#000000;">when the masculine clothes are removed after the saint's death.

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">and in medieval transvestite romances anatomy and a gender performance </span><span style="color:#000000;">are usually brought back into alignment at some point in the heroine's story. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The heroine in masculine dress is spied on or undressed before witnesses and his or her "true" gender is discovered. However, as several of the romances </span><span style="color:#000000;">explicitly set forth, uncovering the body, or stripping the body of its perform­ance, may not be the best way to find evidence of an original, "natural" gender. </span><span style="color:#000000;">In the case of the cross-dressed heroines in two fourteenth-century narratives, </span><span style="color:#000000;">at the moment of discovery the body itself is miraculously transformed to </span><span style="color:#000000;">correspond to its performance. Huon de Bordeaux's </span><span style="color:#000000;">''Yde et Olive ''</span><span style="color:#000000;">recounts the story of Yde, the crossdressed Yde, who marries an emperor's daughter </span><span style="color:#000000;">in her masculine disguise. When the emperor suspects that his son-in-law may </span><span style="color:#000000;">be a woman and that he and his daughter have been duped, he threatens to </span><span style="color:#000000;">burn Yde/Yde at the stake if her/his body does not conform to its clothes. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The heroine is saved when an angel visits Yde and adds to her body "all that </span><span style="color:#000000;">a man has of his humanity."</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>9</sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"> Another miraculous regendering is found in </span><span style="color:#000000;">''Tristan de Nanteuil, ''</span><span style="color:#000000;">where Blanchandin, the cross-dressed Blanchandine, </span><span style="color:#000000;">receives a masculine body to conform to the male identity she has adopted </span><span style="color:#000000;">and which led to her marriage with the daughter of a sultan.</span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup>10</sup></span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">What these romances imagine, however fantastically, is a body whose sexual </span><span style="color:#000000;">features conform to a gender performance. The initial discrepancy set forth </span><span style="color:#000000;">between anatomy and disguise displaces the body as the location of gender, </span><span style="color:#000000;">and the fiction of the regendered body undermines the notion of a stable, </span><span style="color:#000000;">unchanging anatomy that defines a permanent, verifiable identity. The trans­</span><span style="color:#000000;">formation represents the possibility of mutable sexual characteristics and of </span><span style="color:#000000;">a body that is secondary to performance. Yet even the mutable body retains </span><span style="color:#000000;">the authority to determine gender. Whether the body is changed to conform </span><span style="color:#000000;">to the clothes or the clothes to conform to the body, gender ambiguity is </span><span style="color:#000000;">always eliminated. The romances insist on the uniformity of anatomy, per­formance and gender identity in their resolutions, and the body's (changed) </span><span style="color:#000000;">sexual characteristics authorize a gender identification.</span></div>

<div style="margin-left:1.651cm;margin-right:0cm;"><span style="color:#000000;">Medieval romances about transvestite heroines may be seen to participate </span><span style="color:#000000;">in </span><span style="color:#000000;">a wide cultural discussion about the nature of sexual difference. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Joan </span><span style="color:#000000;">Cadden has recently shown that medieval natural philosophers and medical </span><span style="color:#000000;">authors had a flexible understanding of "masculine" and "feminine" traits </span><span style="color:#000000;">and values.
