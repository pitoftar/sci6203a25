<p><strong>I</strong>n 2020, influential comics writer Grant Morrison publicly came out as nonbinary, inviting a reassessment of the role of queer and trans themes in their work. One Arthurian-inflected work that lends itself to this project of reevaluation is the 2005 miniseries <em>Seven Soldiers: Shining Knight</em>, written by Morrison and illustrated by Simone Bianchi. Part of Morrison’s ambitious <em>Seven Soldiers</em> metaseries interweaving stories about lesser-known DC Comics superheroes battling an evil power from beyond time and space, this four-part series within a sprawling seven-part metaseries (with two bookend special issues) features Sir Ystin, an Arthurian knight from a primordial version of Camelot who time-travels to the modern world to defeat the Sheeda, cosmic-horror versions of Celtic fairies responsible for destroying what Morrison portrays as the first manifestation of a cyclically recurring, archetypal Camelot. At the end of the series, Ystin is revealed to be a teenage ‘girl’ named Ystina, although their gender, as we shall see, remains uncertain and ambiguous.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1" class="rid-fn-text">1</a></sup> <strong> [End Page 84] </strong></p>
<p>The transformation of the original Shining Knight of the DC Universe, Sir Justin, into the ambiguously gendered Ystin/Ystina is only the most obvious point of connection in Morrison’s prolific oeuvre where Arthurian elements are linked to trans themes. As this article will explore, the connection between Arthurian literature, trans themes, and comics in Morrison’s work goes far deeper than most people realize, permeating and shaping their distinctively magic- and transformation-oriented envisioning of nonbinary gender. Delving into Morrison’s remarks on superhero literature and how shifts in clothing, presentation, and persona were central to their engagement with this genre from a queer perspective can help us to appreciate how trans themes have featured importantly in Arthurian literature from its very beginnings, and why Arthurian comics are so well-suited to exploring them.</p>
<p>Readers unfamiliar with the world of comics and comics studies may not recognize the name Grant Morrison, or be aware of their superstar standing in both. Morrison, whom the wide-ranging literary scholars Darragh Greene and Kate Roddy unapologetically introduce as ‘quite simply the most successful writer working in comics today’ in a 2015 volume of critical essays on their work,<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text">2</a></sup> was a highly visible member of the British Invasion, a maverick movement of the eighties and nineties iconically associated with Vertigo Comics, an independent imprint published under the DC umbrella.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text">3</a></sup> Every bit as paradigm-shifting (and excitement-generating) as its musical namesake roughly two decades earlier, the movement aimed to recast comic-book writers as auteurs and to increase the general level of literary craft so as to transform the public perception of comics from an escapist, teen-oriented genre with no ambitions beyond the ephemeral into a high-profile creative enterprise producing ambitious, edgy, serial publications that appealed not only to superhero-fixated teens, but also to older and more culturally sophisticated audiences. Inspired by the eye-opening commercial success of cutting-edge <strong> [End Page 85] </strong> British comics author Alan Moore (who emphatically demonstrated that comics’ mainstream and independent sensibilities could coexist harmoniously in <em>Swamp Thing</em> and <em>Watchmen</em>) and propelled by the boldly experimental contributions of younger writers such as Morrison and Neil Gaiman (whose early boundary-pushing comics included, respectively, the metafictional <em>Animal Man</em> and the surreal <em>Sandman</em>),<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text">4</a></sup> the British Invasion reshaped the comics industry in the U.K. and U.S., laying the groundwork for the global, colossally remunerative expansion of the DC and Marvel entertainment empires.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5" class="rid-fn-text">5</a></sup></p>
<p>No quick summary is possible of Morrison’s prolific and varied body of work, which ranges from high-concept mainstream entries that often transformed and reinvigorated established titles—such as <em>JLA</em> (the <em>Justice League of America</em>) and <em>All-Star Superman—</em>to more avant-garde, esoteric outings—such as the <em>Invisibles</em>, which features a motley group of countercultural magical terrorists (one of whom, King Mob, serves as a Morrison stand-in) set on altering the mind-state of the entire world, and <em>Flex Mentallo</em>, a gleefully surreal metafictional reflection on the history and development of the superhero genre.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6" class="rid-fn-text">6</a></sup> Self-referentiality has always been a hallmark of Morrison’s work, alongside playing with narrative structure and framing, and profligately <strong> [End Page 86] </strong> deploying a vast range of cultural and literary references—from obscure early comics, to both Eastern and Western philosophy and literature, to conspiracy theories like alien abduction, to mystic arcana. All of this goes a long way towards explaining the thriving state of Morrison criticism; their range and razzle-dazzle playfulness are hard to resist. As literary scholar Marc Singer explores in his foundational study, <em>Grant Morrison: Combining the Worlds of Contemporary Comics</em>, Morrison’s comics oeuvre is a vast playground of ideas and cultural critique that uses the unique interrelationship of the verbal and visual in comics to engage and challenge many of the political, social, and intellectual orthodoxies of our era, including those of postmodern theory, with the unabashedly grandiose aim of collapsing and synthesizing the binaries that underlie and structure Western thinking. For Singer, this latter philosophical and aesthetic impulse is especially critical: ‘combining’ is the first word of this study’s subtitle, and the first section, which surveys Morrison’s omnivorous melding of genres and approaches, is titled ‘The Union of Opposites.’ As Singer reflects in the final paragraph of the afterword, Morrison ‘continues to develop visual embodiments that sidestep the deferrals of symbolic language while maintaining his [<em>sic</em>] efforts to collapse or unite the binary oppositions that have shaped western culture.’<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7" class="rid-fn-text">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Fittingly, Arthurian comics played a key role in what might be termed Morrison’s origin story of nonbinary identity.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8" class="rid-fn-text">8</a></sup> In interviews, Morrison has described dressing up at age ten or eleven as their favorite comic book hero at the time, Danny Merlin, the boy-magician protagonist of the now-obscure 1970s British comic book <em>Danny Merlin: Son of the Wise</em>. When they looked at themself in the mirror sporting Danny’s bare-legged, ‘mini-toga’ look, pictured below, Morrison experienced a life-changing epiphany: ‘I thought, “My god, I look like one of these models in the <em>Vogue</em> magazines my mom’s got lying about.” So, it kind of messed with my head and in that moment, drag, comics, and magic all hit me like a lightning bolt.’<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9" class="rid-fn-text">9</a></sup> This epiphany, <strong> [End Page 87] </strong> Morrison goes on to explain, was rooted in performance rather than in discovering, embracing, or expressing a clearly defined genderqueer identity: ‘I was interested in performance more than anything to do with gender or sexuality; it was about performance and letting loose all these different characters that I felt was [<em>sic</em>] inside.’<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10" class="rid-fn-text">10</a></sup></p>

<p>Clearly, Morrison’s construction of drag artistry resists simplistic, reductive thinking about gender, and in other interviews, they have expressed their discomfort with fixity of identity in general: ‘I feel there’s lots of me. I love being a really tough guy some days, and I love being a wilting poet other days. I’d feel neutered if I couldn’t be all these things. The notion that we can be labeled and be the same forever, I’m fundamentally opposed to.’<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11" class="rid-fn-text">11</a></sup> This <strong> [End Page 88] </strong> is an elastic viewpoint, as we shall explore later, that resonates deeply with medieval Arthurian literature.</p>
<p>As their extensive comic book oeuvre makes evident, Morrison went on to find creative inspiration in less ephemeral, more canonical treatments of the legends and literature of the Matter of Britain. For example, in their insider history of comics literature, <em>Supergods</em>, Morrison explicitly cites the <em>Mabinogion</em> as providing the conceptual seed for their 1997 Justice League of America story <em>Woman of Tomorrow:</em> ‘JLA no. 5’s story about two mad scientists competing to create an artificial woman so complex that she developed a soul and betrayed them both was derived from “Blodeuwedd,” the eleventh-century <em>Mabinogion</em> tale of the sorcerers Math and Gwydion, who created a woman out of flowers to deceive and destroy the Welsh mythic superhero Lleu Llaw Gyffes.’<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12" class="rid-fn-text">12</a></sup> Morrison’s ambitious, self-proclaimed quest ‘to restore a mythic dimension to the DC universe’ in this late-nineties JLA reboot was synthetic in nature, drawing heavily on the Greek pantheon—‘Superman was Zeus; Wonder Woman, Hera; Batman, Hades; the Flash, Hermes; Green Lantern, Apollo; Aquaman, Neptune; Plastic Man, Dionysus’—but Celtic-Arthurian influences were definitely in the mix.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13" class="rid-fn-text">13</a></sup></p>
<p>In <em>Seven Soldiers: Shining Knight</em>, the connections to early Welsh Arthurian fiction stand front and center. As we have just seen, Morrison was already thinking of the main characters of the <em>Mabinogion</em> as ‘Welsh superheroes’ in the nineties, and the vision of the primordial Camelot they craft in this later miniseries is even more closely attuned to the mythologically oriented narratives of Celtic Arthurian tradition, with their superpowered knights and raids on supernatural realms. In fact, in the backmatter of the closing bookend issue of the metaseries (somewhat confusingly titled, <em>Part One: The Miser’s Coat</em>), Morrison states explicitly that one of their aims was ‘to create a DC Universe science fiction explanation for some of the very early stories in the Mabinogion’ that they grew up on, ‘particularly the “Spoils of Annwn,” which tells the epic tale of Arthur and his knights riding into the bizarre landscape of the Otherworld, in search of the Cauldron of Rebirth.’<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14" class="rid-fn-text">14</a></sup> <strong> [End Page 89] </strong></p>
<p>This intertextual relationship is signposted at the very beginning of the metaseries, <em>Part Zero</em>: <em>Weird Adventures</em> where we witness a seven-member superhero team assembled by a mysterious council of seven mages (the Seven Unknown Men, aka the Time Tailors) mount a doomed assault on the Castle Revolving, the Sheeda citadel that lies outside of time and space. The intertextual parallels with Arthur’s raid on the revolving Caer Sidi (Castle of the Fairies) in the Otherworld in the ‘Spoils of Annwn’ are impossible to miss for anyone familiar with this hauntingly elegiac poem, especially when we remember that only seven survive of the original three boatloads of Arthur’s men, which serves to put a Celtic Arthurian spin on the title of the entire metaseries. Morrison also takes pains to highlight the literary link for those readers who may not be up on their early Celtic literature: in the brief epilogue that ends this introductory issue, we see two of the Time Tailors intoning (slightly tweaked) key lines from the poem’s refrain: ‘And thrice enough to fill Great Arthur’s ship, we went into it; Except seven none returned from Castle Revolving.’<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15" class="rid-fn-text">15</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Shining Knight</em> continues to develop these Celtic Arthurian threads, as Issue 1 gets underway with the destruction of the primordial Camelot. The magical Cauldron of Rebirth featured in the second branch of the <em>Mabinogion</em> is the crux of this miniseries’ plot, as Ystin/Ystina, the last survivor of the Sheeda’s apocalyptic assault on ur-Camelot, battles to retrieve it from the soul-harrowing Sheeda. In Morrison’s dark reimagining of the cauldron, it functions as a monstrous, corrupting force that transforms the slain knights of Camelot into undead servants of the Sheeda and their sadistic queen, Gloriana, an evil twin of Spenser’s Arthurian fairy queen. The <em>Shining Knight’s</em> action concludes with Ystin/Ystina battling a resurrected, morally depraved version of Galahad, who had knighted the young squire in the last moments of the apocalyptic battle against the Sheeda (and whom, as we learn from a speech-bubble soliloquy, they secretly love).</p>
<p>Elements drawn from Celtic Arthurian tradition figure importantly in other strands of the metaseries as well; for example, in <em>Seven Soldiers: Zatanna</em>—whose titular character is a celebrity stage magician with a fondness for fishnet stockings and gloves who doubles as a real magician—we see Morrison returning to the same tale of artificial human creation from the <strong> [End Page 90] </strong> fourth branch of the <em>Mabinogion</em> that they had previously mined in JLA. In this new iteration of the Blodeuwedd story, Zatanna’s attempt to bring her ideal man into existence goes badly awry and she ends up summoning a monstrous being named Gwydion. The basic Frankenstein-like plotline is preserved intact, but Morrison switches the gender of both the magician-creator and created being.</p>
<p>This brings us to the central focus of this article: the transgender elements of Morrison’s work, which, as we shall see, also draw inventively on and resonate powerfully with Arthurian literary traditions. As noted above, Morrison’s version of the Blodeuwedd story not only transforms the magically created being to a man, but also names him Gwydion, one of the co-creators of the flower-woman in the original Welsh tale. This nominal alteration serves to activate a whole host of genderqueer associations, since Gwydion also features centrally in an earlier, wildly transgender story from the same branch of the <em>Mabinogion</em> in which Math punishes his nephews Gilfaethwy and Gwydion for the rape of his virginal handmaiden, Goewin. When the two rapists submit themselves for judgment, the king uses his shapeshifting magic to transform them into mated pairs of animals, with the two brothers alternating between male and female. For three seasons—first as deer, then wild pigs, then wolves—the female of the transformed brothers becomes pregnant and gives birth, producing three animal offspring whom Math later transforms into human boys. At this point, Math declares the punishment of the transgressors complete and restores them to their former human and male identities. Given this intertextual background, Morrison’s naming of the Blodeuwedd analogue in the Zatanna storyline ‘Gwydion’ serves to spotlight the thematic importance of transformations of gender identity.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16" class="rid-fn-text">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The genderqueer Ystin/Ystina storyline in <em>Shining Knight</em> activates equally strong Arthurian resonances. However, before exploring these intertextual connections, I first want to spend a moment justifying my use of ‘transgender’ to describe a storyline that some might characterize as cross-dressing or transvestite, and my associated decision to refer to the superhero knight-protagonist with they/them pronouns throughout this article. There is, after all, no question that the Shining Knight possesses physical characteristics that would define them culturally as female—as the Sheeda queen dramatically reveals when she announces that she detects the scent of menstrual blood while they are in the midst of dueling the resurrected, brutish version of Galahad. Furthermore, from the moment Ystin is outed by the queen as Ystina, the text shifts to using female pronouns, and our final, valedictory sight of this <strong> [End Page 91] </strong> Arthurian character (near the end of the last issue of the metaseries) is also strongly female-presenting: the teenage superhero sits on a hill overlooking a boarding school outfitted in a girlishly demure, uniform-like white top and pleated skirt, while an incognito, top-hatted Time Tailor explains that this educational respite is needed so that the time-traveler can acclimate to the twenty-first century, revealing that they have/had a glorious past-future in store as the ‘good Queen Ystina.’<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17" class="rid-fn-text">17</a></sup> So far, so female.</p>
<p>Yet one look at the climactic page of the final issue of the series, pictured below, will suffice to disrupt this normatively gendered narrative arc. Spanning the top of the page, we see the anguished protagonist, who has heretofore endured Galahad’s battering without attacking in the hopes of reawakening his noble spirit, accept his irredeemable brutishness, grab two swords, and explode into action, as they scissor the head off their beloved former mentor in a gasp-inducing freeze-frame swoop. Their hair looks electrified, blood sprays outward in snake-like rivulets from Galahad’s severed jaws, and the background of the page-wide panel practically pops with the radial energy of a golden sunburst. In the crossed rectangular panels situated below, we first see a stark, horizontal inset of the Shining Knight’s black-shadowed, glaring eyes. Next, our eyes move farther downward to paired vertical panels showing the blood-splattered hero emerging from a darkened doorway, and then standing dramatically (their head breaks the framing space of the panel to loom towards us) surrounded by golden light. The blood-splattered, still shadowed figure, who grips a sword in one hand and the decapitated head of Galahad in the other, speaks grimly poetic lines dripping with violent menace: ‘Red am I in battle. Red the ravens that follow at my heels. Gloriana, I am your death.’</p>
<p>Across this eye-popping page, gender ambiguity reigns. While the Shining Knight’s bound chest is a traditional signifier of underlying femaleness, note that there is not so much as a bump of actual breasts beneath the bindings; the prominent nipples of the hyper-masculine Galahad are much more eye-catching. And in the three medium- and full-shot rectangular insets on the lower portion of the page, the decapitating hero is portrayed not as nubile (the default presentation for female superheroes that Morrison later critiques in the pornocentric <em>Seven Soldiers</em> Bulleteer storyline) but as boyishly androgynous, more Donatello’s <em>David</em> than Gentileschi’s <em>Judith and Holofernes</em>.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18" class="rid-fn-text">18</a></sup> The extreme <strong> [End Page 92] </strong> horizontal close-up of their eyes simultaneously radiates male ferocity (there is even a suggestion of brow ridges) and female feeling (those brimming tears), while the thick ebony shadowing of the eye sockets is more suggestive of threatening mask than beautifying kohl. The composition, in short, is a union of opposites: light and dark, fluidity and fixity, ferocity and tears, menstrual blood and battle-blood, female and male. Here, at the climax of the action, the gender of the Shining Knight is inked in an uncertainty that no accompanying shift in pronoun use or later presentation in a schoolgirl outfit can erase.</p>

<p class="clearfloat"></p>
<p>To anyone familiar with Arthurian literature, the connections of the Ystin/Ystina story to medieval romance are obvious. One thinks immediately of the story of Avenable/Grisandolus, best-known from the Middle English Prose <strong> [End Page 93] </strong> <em>Merlin</em>, in which a young squire, assigned female at birth, takes service as a knight under Julius Caesar and is ultimately outed by the shape-shifting Merlin, who also reveals that the empress’ twelve handmaidens are female-presenting men.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19" class="rid-fn-text">19</a></sup> Grisandolus themself stays silent throughout these climactic revelations, just as they had earlier listened mutely to Merlin’s misogynistic outbursts on the duplicitous and lecherous nature of the female sex; consequently, we are never privy to their own sentiments on these matters.</p>
<p>Yet here, just as in the Ystin/Ystina story, what appears to be a straightforward cross-dressing narrative offers material for a much more radical trans reading. First, the textual attention lavished on the female semblance of the handmaidens pushes readers/listeners to focus on the whole issue of nonnormative gender presentation and to consider its possible pleasures. Second, there is a striking instance of pronominal gender-switching when ‘Grisandollus’ is referred to as ‘hir’ in one sentence and as ‘hym’ only a sentence later.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20" class="rid-fn-text">20</a></sup> Finally, even the loudly patriarchal ending—in which Grisandolus seems publicly silenced and relegated to traditional female subservience in an apparent restoration of gender normativity—is slyly problematized by Merlin’s exaction of a promise from Caesar that he will honor his new spouse’s every wish. This gives readers room to imagine a more autonomous, genderqueer future for the knight-turned-wife; as disability, queer, and medievalism studies scholar Jess Battis remarks, ‘As far as we know, he reverts back to knighthood the moment after the ceremony.’<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21" class="rid-fn-text">21</a></sup></p>
<p>But the Arthurian text that resonates most strongly with <em>Shining Knight</em> is Heldris of Cornwall’s <em>Le Roman de Silence</em>. I cannot do justice here to the richly genderqueer plot of this once-obscure but now widely known thirteenth-century romance, in which aristocratic parents evade a new law invalidating female inheritance by raising their only child, assigned female at birth, as a boy—a boy who grows up to have a wildly successful career <strong> [End Page 94] </strong> as first a troubadour and then a knight, achieving preeminence in both vocations.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22" class="rid-fn-text">22</a></sup> Like Grisandolus, Silence is eventually outed by Merlin at court and then is quickly married off to the newly widowed ruler of the realm, in this case, King Evan of England, who has just sentenced his mendacious and lascivious wife to be executed for falsely accusing Silence of rape. (In a further parallel to the Grisandolus story, Merlin also outs the cross-dressed nun with whom the queen has been adulterously dallying.) Adding enormously to the genderqueer doings are the periodic allegorical appearances in the story of Nature, Nurture, and Reason, who visit Silence to argue over issues of gender identity and presentation.</p>
<p>Masha Raskolnikov has presented a nuanced and persuasive argument that, for all that its Merlin-overseen outcome seems to rob Silence of their gender autonomy and push them into traditional female subservience—reinforcing their original lack of freedom to choose their own gender as a child—this is in many ways a genderqueer-affirming text that powerfully denaturalizes gender binaries. Admittedly, as Raskolnikov discusses, it pointedly switches to exclusively female pronouns for the protagonist after Merlin’s dramatic reveal, yet this does not negate the respect it has previously shown ‘for the character’s own self-identification by using male pronouns when Silence is “performing” as male.’<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23" class="rid-fn-text">23</a></sup> Moreover, the text portrays Silence’s male identity as not merely a matter of outward presentation but something that has become inscribed on their body; it takes three full days of labor for Nature to soften the rough skin and hard muscles that mark Silence as male, thereby establishing a textual logic in which ‘life <em>as</em> a man fundamentally transforms one <em>into</em> a man’<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24" class="rid-fn-text">24</a></sup> In this reading, Silence’s gender remains fundamentally ambiguous, a matter of performance and personal choice.</p>
<p>This is a text, in short, the ending of which resonates profoundly with the climactic page from <em>Shining Knight</em> whose gender ambiguities were explored in the panel analysis above. The fate of Silentius, who is stripped of their clothing before the entire court after Merlin has pronounced her female and then is re-outfitted in female garb as Silentia, maps perfectly onto the end of the Shining Knight’s story arc, where the stripped Ystin becomes Ystina, reclothed in female pronouns and a pleated skirt. In both cases, it is not the <strong> [End Page 95] </strong> hasty, essentialist regendering imposed (without their input) on the knightly protagonists at the story’s end that leaves the deepest impression on readers, but rather how successfully they each performed in their lives as male, reaching the very pinnacle of their male-gendered vocations. In the end, the stories of Grisandolus, Silence, and the Shining Knight do not so much promote an essentialist view of gender as shine a spotlight on its performative complexities. All three texts depict a world where life as a woman or a man need not be determined by biological sex.</p>
<p>In <em>Seven Soldiers</em>, this nonnormative take on gender is part of a wider metatheme exploring performativity and transformations of identity. This is especially evident in the magic-oriented <em>Zatanna</em> miniseries, where the Gwydion storyline moves beyond gender identity by introducing another Arthurian reference: the ‘ideal’ partner Zatanna summons into being is eventually revealed to be the ‘Merlin Sprite,’ one of the seven imperishable treasures central to resolving the overarching storyline. In their initial appearance as the monstrous Gwydion, this infinitely malleable being—who sometimes serves good and sometimes evil—is under the control of Zor, the behind-the-scenes archvillain of the metaseries, who is a renegade member of the aforementioned Time Tailors. Throughout the metaseries, these ‘seven unknown men’ are shown manipulating the threads of fate using a futuristic-looking cosmic sewing machine. Craftily manipulating the Sheeda to usurp control over all history, the renegade Zor warps the fates of other beings by weaving temporal ‘outfits’ for them. Throughout the entire metaseries, The Time Tailors hover behind the unfolding action as symbolic figures of authorial creation—always a collective enterprise in the comics—while instructively modeling the transformational power of fashion, clothing, and presentation.</p>
<p>Zatanna, a master of sleight-of-hand and possessor of a vast wardrobe that her assistant points out contributes importantly to her magic, is the only one of the seven superhero protagonists to initiate contact with the authorial Time Tailors and to actually witness their cutting and stitching of the fabric of fate in action. In the evocative ‘metapanel’ pictured below, Zatanna uses her own magic to break through the levels of narrative reality, reaching out to the mages for help as they loom over the margins of the frame, collectively reshaping human characters and events to their desired specifications like a cosmic alterations team of black-suited, alien-eyed couturiers. Fashion and presentation, in this metaseries, are tools of creative transformation, capable of altering the very nature of reality. <strong> [End Page 96] </strong></p>

<p>We can see these same themes in flamboyant operation in Morrison’s most recent Arthurian-inflected work, the prose novel <em>Luda</em>. Written shortly after Morrison came out as nonbinary, this is one of their most explicitly queer and deeply personal works to date. Set in an alternative version of their hometown of Glasgow, <em>Luda</em> is structured around a rivalry between two transfeminine drag queens struggling for dominance in the city’s thriving underground magical/art world. The heart of the novel is the intimate and conflicted relationship between the novel’s first-person narrator, Luci LaBang, an aging avant-garde drag performer worrying about the loss of her beauty and conscious of her looming mortality, and her young apprentice Luda, a <strong> [End Page 97] </strong> theatrical Fair Unknown whom she initiates into the ways of a form of magic based on fashion and makeup that both characters refer to as ‘the Glamour.’<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25" class="rid-fn-text">25</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Luda</em> draws on a broad range of intertextual influences—from the very British genre of pantomime and its parodic cross-dressing dames, to the 1950 protégée-devours-mentor Bette Davis film <em>All About Eve</em>, whose camp aura has won it a strong queer audience. But as Morrison signals in the book’s epigraph drawn from the Merlin and Vivien section of Tennyson’s <em>Idylls of the King</em>, its principal literary debt is Arthurian.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26" class="rid-fn-text">26</a></sup> In promotional interviews, Morrison has explicitly described the novel as ‘a retelling of the old story of Merlin, the magician,’ and certainly, there is no missing the Merlin-Vivien plot parallels with Malory and the Vulgate Cycle, as the manipulative teenage Luda (who enters the narrative in the persona of a down-and-out rent boy who morphs into a glamorous young thing, emphatically feminine, before Luci’s entranced eyes) is instructed in the ways of esoteric magic by her much-older mentor and then attempts to usurp her position and power.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27" class="rid-fn-text">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Allusions to Arthurian literature abound—there are five explicit mentions of the Grail, and a key scene that introduces readers to the transformative magic of ‘the Glamour’ (where the narrator remakes herself into Luci LaBang in her full stage glory) figures her surfacing reflection in the trifold makeup mirror as the Lady of the Lake. This ritualized transformation, which begins with the triple invocation ‘Luci, Luci, Luci’ and ends with the narrator channeling the spirit of the ‘blended-gender’ Mercurius, concludes in reverent, sacramental silence: ‘In that hush profound there was only the <em>Sangreal</em> glow of the face in the mirror.’<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28" class="rid-fn-text">28</a></sup> Mercurius is summoned again, this time far more frantically, when Luci gives Luda her first tutorial in the Glamour, which ends in the ‘gasping invocation’: ‘Inbetweenie! Manniequeenie! Sisterbrothersupergenie! . . . I am you are me are we Mercurius am he are she!’<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29" class="rid-fn-text">29</a></sup> Eventually, Luda makes her move in a problematizing climax that leaves readers uncertain of which artist has murdered the other, or if Luda is a Jungian shadow projection and the two are actually one.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30" class="rid-fn-text">30</a></sup> <strong> [End Page 98] </strong></p>
<p>As the just-quoted pronominal outpouring indicates, Morrison’s pronoun use throughout this novel is nothing if not ludic; while both drag queens are identified most frequently as ‘she’—a practice I have followed here for clarity—there are plenty of slippages and referential tangles along the way that thoroughly denaturalize gender, such as: ‘How could I fail to be? He’d done her research’; and, ‘She’s a boy playing a girl playing a boy.’<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31" class="rid-fn-text">31</a></sup> With pronominal gendering as with plot, all possibilities remain open, and nothing is closed off.</p>
<p>‘The Glamour’ that lies at the heart of this novel is a system of magic built around fashion, performance, and self-presentation. As Luci puts it:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The Glamour was a method whereby we could put makeup on the dullest moment, transforming it into its own best self.</p>
<p>The Glamour—the original name for magic, for spells made of words and intent—was the dazzling cloak we threw over the ordinary world to make it shine and dance and live up to its potential.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32" class="rid-fn-text">32</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This razzle-dazzle cloaking is, of course, highly reminiscent of the of the clothing-based magic practiced by the cosmic Time Tailors in <em>Seven Soldiers</em>, and one emerges from the experience of reading <em>Luda</em> more aware than ever of the deliberate ambiguities and open-endedness of the treatment of gender and gender presentation in Morrison’s work. The ‘Glamour’ that Morrison presents in this novel as the continuation of the magic practiced in the Arthurian world by the shape-shifting, half-human and half-demon Merlin is quicksilver and performative, a mystical exercise in transforming identity.</p>
<p>It is this ecstatic transformativity that connects it so powerfully with the Arthurian Grail. As we have seen, <em>Seven Soldiers</em> is essentially structured as a grail quest—indeed, the cauldron of the ‘Spoils of Annwn’ has been interpreted by some scholars as an analogue of the Holy Grail<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33" class="rid-fn-text">33</a></sup>—and in <em>Luda</em>, the transformative essence of the Arthurian Grail (which, in the iconic Vulgate/Robert de Boron tradition, represents the Eucharistic chalice in which wine is sacramentally transformed to Christ’s blood) aligns it with the <strong> [End Page 99] </strong> ‘<em>Sangreal</em> glow of the face in the mirror’ that brings the transformed Luci such ecstasy. Gender, throughout Morrison’s work, both in comics and in written prose, is a component of ourselves we summon through performance and presentation, a thing of alchemical manipulation and sacramental mystery.</p>
<p>Delving into Morrison’s Arthurian-inflected, capacious, performative envisioning of gender, I want to suggest, can lead us to think about transgender themes in Arthurian literature in new and illuminating ways. In particular, it can help us to move away from a narrow, text-based approach that concentrates on overtly genderqueer works like <em>Silence</em> to one that recognizes the variability and richness of thinking about gender across the entire canon. The <em>Mabinogion</em> may not be a treatise on nonnormative gender, but it contains plenty of material that encourages deep thinking about the issue in all its complexity, and the same is true of Arthurian romance—one has only to think of Chrétien de Troyes’ foundational <em>La chevalier de la charrette</em>, with its ‘Lady/Man’ protagonist who is not once, but twice symbolically deflowered in bed (the first time when a lance that falls mysteriously from above and cuts his thigh and the second when his blood stains the sheets after his ecstatic tryst with Guinevere).<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34" class="rid-fn-text">34</a></sup> From this perspective, Arthurian literature broadly constitutes a rich repository of thought experiments on constructing gender, and nonbinary and performative ways of thinking have been present from its very beginnings. (As an intriguing corollary, such a viewpoint makes the many popular genderqueer rewritings of Arthurian tales in contemporary young adult fiction appear less revisionist than revivalist.)</p>
<p>This brings us to a second insight: that Arthurian comics are particularly well-suited to exploring transgender themes. There is no room here to analyze, or even list, the myriad ways in which the DC and Marvel multiverses of contemporary superhero fiction mirror the similarly expansive ‘multiverse’ of medieval Arthurian literature. With their continual reboots, vast casts of both iconic and standalone characters, fractal complexity, interlaced narratives, fascination with secret identities/incognito adventuring, and predilection for voluminous cycles and compilations, both these open-ended megagenres— fueled by constant reinvention and reinterpretation—lend themselves  to transgender ways of thinking, to the narrative logic that Gabrielle M.W. Bychowski, one of the founding figures of medieval transgender studies, terms <strong> [End Page 100] </strong> ‘transvestite metaphysics’ in her ambitious analysis of <em>Silence</em> in tandem with medieval philosophical texts.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35" class="rid-fn-text">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the cross-fertilization between the two domains has proved especially fertile ground for trans themes: before <em>Seven Soldiers</em>, whose densely interlaced structure rivals that of the Prose <em>Lancelot</em>,<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36" class="rid-fn-text">36</a></sup> there was the 1982–85 Arthurian series <em>Camelot 3000</em>, where Tristan is reincarnated in the body of a woman, while later, as mentioned above, the dark Arthurian title <em>Demon Knights</em> gives the Shining Knight an explicitly (self-declared) nonbinary gender identity.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37" class="rid-fn-text">37</a></sup> And, perhaps most strikingly of all, there is the Japanese <em>Fate</em> franchise—a multimedia, multi-branching narrative centered on the Holy Grail War that is every bit as intimidatingly complex as Arthurian cyclical romance and the American DC and Marvel superhero universes, with a woman-warrior Arthur modeled on Joan of Arc and an ambiguously gendered Mordred.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38" class="rid-fn-text">38</a></sup></p>
<p>As I have tried to elucidate in this article, putting Morrison into conversation with medieval Arthurian literature—listening for the resonances between the Glamour and the Grail—yields valuable insights into both. The treatment of gender in Arthurian romances, when approached from the deeply ambiguous presentation of gender in the <em>Shining Knight</em> and the ludic him/her/their permutations of <em>Luda</em>—takes on greater consequence and emerges much more clearly as something protean and performative rather than biologically fixed. It becomes easier to see that not just traditional gender roles, but gender identity itself is being subjected to regular interrogation in this <strong> [End Page 101] </strong> ludic medieval genre, from Chrétien’s radical ‘thought experiments’ onward. Similarly, when one returns from this time-traveling exercise to examine the Arthurian allusions and themes in Morrison, it becomes increasingly obvious just how central a role non-normative gender plays across the entirety of their oeuvre. The ‘union of opposites’ that critics have always discerned as central to their work—their fascination ‘with the question of choice between (or beyond) sides within any given binary system’ and with exploring ‘conceptual continua,’ as the introduction to the special issue of <em>ImageTexT</em> devoted to Morrison’s works puts it<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39" class="rid-fn-text">39</a></sup>—stands revealed as intrinsically linked to their fluid, expansive, performative approach to gender identity, an approach they themself so evocatively trace back to their childhood ‘Danny-Merlin’ epiphany, a moment of Jungian transcendence that forever united comics, costume, magic, nonnormative gender, and Arthuriana as enduring drivers of their creative libido.</p>
<p>And finally, zooming out for the big-picture finish, this time-hopping, genre-crossing investigation of trans themes in Arthurian texts has two significant broader implications. First, it affirms the scholarly benefits of continuing to broaden the Arthurian canon, of considering comics and graphic novels alongside chivalric romances, contemporary DC and Marvel metaseries alongside high-medieval cycles. Second, and far more consequentially, it contributes to the ongoing project in trans studies to construct a solid and robust historical genealogy of nonbinary and nonessentialist thinking about gender identity in ‘traditional’ Western literature, a project of urgent relevance in our culturally polarized world. Arthuriana, both medieval and modern, turns out to be an intrinsically productive space to explore the authenticity of trans identity. <strong> [End Page 102] </strong></p>
