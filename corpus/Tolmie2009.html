<div class="title">Abstract</div>
<p>
	  Following on from Howard Bloch’s investigation of a ‘refusal of univocal meaning’ in the thirteenth-century <em>Roman de Silence</em>, this article examines the poem as inviting critics to investigate the collapse of binary systems such as male/female, in/out, language/silence, learned/natural, reward/punishment, innocent/guilty. Moving away from Bloch’s focus on poetic language, this article examines the poem’s systematic conflation of a woman’s life with images of death and captivity. The action of the poem, and the characters within the poem, draw our attention to issues of gender performance in such a manner as to render it impossible for the poem’s conservative ending to unsay or undo (to silence) the main body of the romance.

      A particular scene in the thirteenth-century Old French <em>Roman de Silence</em> offers a key to the hermeneutics of the entire poem.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>2</sup></a> When Silence is twelve years old, Nature appears to her and has a number of things to say. Nature is disgusted that Silence is living her life as a man and orders her to cease and desist, adding, ‘Va en la cambre a la costure, | Cho violt de nature li us. | Tu nen es pas Scilentius!’ (‘Go to a chamber and learn to sew! | That’s what Nature’s usage wants of you! | You are not Silentius!’ (ll. 2528–30)).<a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>3</sup></a> More <strong> [End Page 14] </strong>literally, Nature’s instruction is merely to ‘Go into the sewing room’.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>4</sup></a> Nature’s rebuke plunges Silence into self-doubt. Suddenly Silence wants to go into the feminine and seemingly transformative space of the sewing chamber. Only the timely arrival of Noreture (Nurture), who offers strong counter-arguments, prevents an early closing-off of the narrative possibilities opened up for Silence by her transformation from Scilenscia to Scilentius, from legal non-entity to legitimate heir. In this scene, Silence is temporarily paralyzed: poised between identities and assailed by opposing powers. Ultimately, this is the position she occupies, in one way or another, for the remainder of the romance. As R. Howard Bloch observes in a seminal article, ‘Silence represents the systematic refusal of univocal meaning’.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>5</sup></a>
    </p>
<p>
      For Bloch, the conservative ending of the poem – marriage, and silence, for Silence – highlights the ‘impossibility both of silence and of an always already dislocated speech’ (p. 99). Bloch’s frame for Silence is that of poetic language, and the poem thus ‘focuses precisely upon the attempt to bring the suffix <em>–a</em> into consonance with the sexual identity of its bearer’ (p. 87). Not only does the ultimate restoration of Silence’s proper name restore the rule of nature and of sexual difference as a ground of understanding, but the very ‘propriety of names, thus posited at the level of nature, serve[s] to guarantee – through writing – what [is] perceived as a natural social order’.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>6</sup></a> Yet, as Bloch also points out, the <em>Roman de Silence</em> is ‘all about misreading’ and ‘paradox’ (p. 89). Both Nature and Noreture alike appear to be deeply invested in what is cultural and acquired, leaving us to wonder about both the meaning of nature and the nature of meaning, and then to join Silence in doubt: ‘Qui sui jo donques?’ (‘Who am I then?’ (l. 2532)).
    </p>
<p>
      It is a question answered in the end with silence, but there is more at stake than language/silence, or reading/misreading. In Marjorie Garber’s formulation, Silence is a figure of ‘category crisis’ – the ‘crisis of category itself’.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>7</sup></a> Bloch makes the claim that Silence is ‘inexplicably attracted to poetry’ and thus joins a troupe of itinerant jongleurs.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>8</sup></a> However, her desire to learn the musical and poetic arts is not at all inexplicable, and the explanation returns us to the question of what place, if any, Silence might ever occupy in the sewing chamber or any other feminine space. This is a question that endures beyond the end of the text. For Silence to enter the sewing chamber is for her to enter into a form of bondage or captivity, a space of imprisonment — and most importantly, <em>not</em> a space in which she naturally knows how to behave as a woman. In this text, feminine arts are learned, and Silence mourns to herself that she needs to learn (‘aprendre’ (l. 2836)) some skills that might be useful should her disguise be penetrated. Sarah Roche-Mahdi’s <strong> [End Page 15] </strong>decision to include the injunction ‘go [. . .] and <em>learn</em> to sew’ rather than the more literal ‘go to the sewing chamber’ is explicable given the poem’s development of Silence’s misgivings about her lack of feminine skills, specifically including skills useful in the sewing chamber. Silence herself describes women’s lives as dull and servile, and takes up minstrelsy not just out of desire for poetic/musical knowledge but out of anxiety that she is not equipped to function as a woman in society. She says to herself:

    Silence’s fear in this scene is double-edged, as she simultaneously expresses strong anxiety about the possibility that she may fail as a fighter and prove inadequate in the realm of men, that of <em>chevalrie</em> (l. 2863). Once again, she is poised between two motivations and two identities. Afraid to be a (failed/not) woman, afraid to be a (failed/not) man, she nevertheless imagines herself as having some form of voice even from a position of captivity.

    Sigmund Freud approaches the question of negativity through food metaphors; he likens it to the spitting out of food, and finds that the rejected thing remains paradoxically essential and central to the mind and subjectivity of the rejecter. Though the subject wants to retain all good things and to reject all bad things – ‘alles Gute sich introjizieren, alles Schlecte von sich werfen’ – in the end what is bad/rejected/strange remains tied up with the rejecter’s own subjectivity: ‘The negative, that which is alien to the “I”, that which is situated outside, is first of all identical to the self’ (‘das Schlechte, das dem Ich Fremde, das Außenbefindliche, ist ihm zunächst identisch’).<a name="f9-text" href="#f9" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>9</sup></a> The corollary is that no sentences are so revealing to the analyst as ‘I did not think that’/‘I never thought that’ (‘Das habe ich nicht gedacht’ or ‘Das habe ich nicht (nie) gedacht’). Julia Kristeva develops the idea of dependence between rejecter and rejected in <em>Pouvoirs de l’horreur</em>, pointing to the importance of rejection to the subject-formation (the self-conception or situating of selfhood) of rejecting bodies. Using a premise of food loathing similar to Freud’s, Kristeva moves from the image of spitting out the (harmless) skin on milk to the insight that the motion of rejection is one of abjection that is essential to one’s own subject-formation. <strong> [End Page 16] </strong>
  </p>
<p>
    An essential aspect of Kristeva’s notion of abjection is that it is not objectification as such:
  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
      L’abjet n’est pas un ob-jet en face de moi, que je nomme ou que j’imagine. [. . .] De l’objet, l’abject n’a qu’une qualité – celle d’opposer à <em>je</em>. Mais si l’objet, en s’opposant, m’équilibre dans la trame fragile d’un désir de sens qui, en fait, m’homologue indéfiniment, infiniment à lui, au contraire, l’<em>abject</em>, objet chu, est radicalement un exclu et me tire vers là où le sens s’effondre.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>10</sup></a>
    </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
    The place where meaning collapses, ‘là où le sens s’effondre’, is where Silence lives.
  </p>
<p>
    The interpretive frame of this poem invites us to move beyond oppositional relationships such as language/silence – beyond male/female, order/chaos, presence/absence, light/dark, good/evil, innocent/guilty, in/out, subject/abject. Is this a poem in which the first term is valued over the second term? In one sense the answer is yes, as the poem ends with disclosures in language, with male mastery, with order and presence at court and within the household, with light in dark corners, and with the punishment of the guilty. In another sense, the answer is no, and the second terms – female, absence, silence, guilty, out, abject – persist around the edges (and beyond the end) of the text. The <em>Roman de Silence</em> deliberately highlights dialogues between the first and second terms in binary systems. How do we separate the strong from the weak, or the innocent from the guilty, in the world of this poem? Silence is spectacularly successful as a martial figure, yet the poet every now and again implies that God is helping out with the fighting, so how can her strength or weakness – or the exact nature of God’s approval of her cross-dressing – be precisely evaluated? King Ebain is guilty of legal injustice, Silence is guilty of a lifetime of lying. The king repeals his unjust law in the end, and Silence reveals her true name. But the king is still guilty, and we still have doubts about Silence’s true nature, if not her true name.
  </p>
<p>
    Obviously, the <em>Roman de Silence</em> has much to say about the disposition of women, children and property within patriarchal systems; about transvestism and gender performance; about roles for women in medieval romance and, of course, about the constant through-a-glass-darkly problem of approaching female voices in early male-authored texts. The problem of Silence, with her unstable sexual identity and ever-receding voice, is microcosmic of many problems in the field of medieval studies, and especially of problems for feminist critics interested in depictions of sex roles in early literature. Silence dips more than enough toes into the masculine realm to open up the one-sex model debate, as her successes in the masculine world cannot be contained or disabled by her ultimate repositioning within a female world of marriage and household. The substitutive logic that sustains the disguise motif is sharply at odds with the apparent final premise of the romance, which is that Nature always wins in the end. In Roche-Mahdi’s terms, <strong> [End Page 17] </strong>‘Nature, as procreatrix, abhors the transvestite’.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>11</sup></a> Maybe so, but Silence is diminished by marriage in a manner that highlights the act of silencing itself. The <em>Roman de Silence</em> first raises and then tries to suppress the issue of gender performance.
  </p>
<p>
    Despite the conservative ending of the romance, and despite a creeping anti-feminism evident at several levels (for instance, in the text’s numerous punning comments about how desirable it is for women to be silent), the poem invites critical approaches that do not posit a monolithic or unproblematic model for patriarchy. Claire Sponsler points out that one of the major critical problems faced by medievalists is that ‘the Middle Ages are so often understood to have been shaped by a monolithic and homogenizing patriarchal regime that predates modern constructions of sexuality and otherness’.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>12</sup></a> Silence is precisely the kind of character around whom fractures and breakages in the so-called natural order are most visible. She says to herself, ‘a la male eure | Irai desos, quant sui deseure’ (‘it would be too bad | to step down when I’m on top’ (ll. 2639–40)). Here Roche-Mahdi’s phrase ‘it would be too bad’ falls short of the sense of disaster, doom and negative transformation expressed in the original, just as the translation also overlooks the sexual imagery in play.
  </p>
<p>
    Stephen Orgel makes a relevant point when he argues that it is necessary to regard the products of all-male theatrical traditions as ‘cultural fantasies’ in which ‘women are implicated [. . .] as well as men’ rather than purely ‘male fantasies’.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>13</sup></a> This is a useful notion for looking at female characters in early male-authored texts, especially when considering transvestism as a form of gender theatre. The nature of Silence’s adventures does disable even the possibility of any model for female adventure and heroism that is not male – effectively, to have adventures, you must be a man socially — but those adventures open up the possibilities that cannot be dismissed. Kathleen J. Brahney points to a ‘positive, forceful portrait of womanhood which runs counter to the misogynistic tide of much of thirteenth-century French literature’.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>14</sup></a>
  </p>
<p>
    So who is Silence, to return to her own question, before she is silenced? Silence is the daughter of Cador and Eufemie of Cornwall, who is raised as a boy in order to get around a ban on female inheritance.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>15</sup></a> The ban provides the reasoning behind the disguise motif of the romance, which orbits an anxiety about female inheritance as disruptive to patrimony. When women do inherit in this romance, they are strategically married to people judged to be appropriate by the king – one of whom, in the end, is of <strong> [End Page 18] </strong>course Ebain himself, to whom much of the disputed property of the romance ultimately devolves.
  </p>
<p>
    Silence’s escape from quotidian female life is temporary, though this temporary phenomenon is what fuels the fictional possibilities of the romance. She runs away from home at a young age to learn minstrelsy, and becomes famous; she then returns home and is trained as a knight, at which she is also notably successful. She moves to the court of King Ebain, where Queen Eufeme develops a sexual interest in her. At two distinct points, Eufeme, angry over being repeatedly rejected, pretends that Silence tries to rape or compromise her. This Potiphar’s-wife motif, in which the wife of the king attempts to seduce the hero, is familiar from a range of texts including of course Marie de France’s <em>Lanval</em> plus anonymous lais such as <em>Desire, Grailant More, Guingamor</em>, and others. As is the case in <em>Lanval</em> and elsewhere, the Queen’s false words have profound effects on crafting the story. Eufeme’s angry claims result in punishments for Silence, the first being exile to the court of the King of France, where her sterling qualities prevent her execution despite the Queen’s long-distance efforts. Silence is eventually recalled to England in wartime, and distinguishes herself in the fighting. Her second punishment is the seemingly hopeless quest to find Merlin and bring him to court. Ebain and Eufeme believe the quest to be hopeless because of Merlin’s prophecy that only a woman’s trick will catch him. Silence, of course, succeeds in tricking and catching him. Merlin’s antics at court soon result in the destruction of the evil Queen and her lover (a man disguised as a nun) and the uncovering of Silence’s true sex. Ebain executes Eufeme and takes Silence as his new wife. She never speaks, or cross-dresses, again.
  </p>
<p>
    Silence’s repositioning within the household marks the end of the war —which at times is actually physically violent – between Nature and Noreture. This war is depicted as one that must end in defeat for one party, never in reconciliation or compromise. Silence’s adventures and successes in the masculine realm are construed as a series of battles won by Noreture; the ending of the romance marks the ending of the war in favour of Nature. Yet, the end of hostilities does not retroactively erase all of the possibilities opened up in the course of the romance; once again our attention is drawn to what cannot be unsaid or undone. Jean E. Howard comments that ‘struggle, resistance, and subversive masquerade are terms as important as recuperation and containment’.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>16</sup></a> Silence’s subversive masquerade is not fully contained.
  </p>
<p>
    For Silence, transvestism is the precondition for the acquisition of distinction in the public realm. The disguise motif, so common to medieval romance, highlights the need to act like a man. If men and women are to be <strong> [End Page 19] </strong>players in the same game, they must do so on male terms, in male clothing. The unveiling of Silence’s true identity and sex leads immediately to a change of clothing for her and to her repositioning within domestic space. In several medieval French romances, the female-to-male disguise motif leads to a literalization of the disguise, and the woman actually becomes a man, as is the case, for example, in the fourteenth-century <em>Tristan de Nanteuil</em>, where the cross-dressed Blanchandine becomes Blanchandin. Valerie Hotchkiss observes that
  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
      Male disguise, as a literary device, allows authors to develop nontraditional female characters but, in most cases, foists a male model of fictional heroism into female characters. Such characters, nonetheless, challenge the concept of biologically determined gender. Several authors comment on the innate ‘masculine’ abilities of the women, revealing the problem at the heart of much of the literature of female disguise: the absence of language and context for portraying female heroism. Because the signifiers of heroism and the imagery for strength, perseverance, and virtue are masculine, the masculinization and, consequentially, the cross-dressing of active female protagonists cannot be avoided.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>17</sup></a>
    </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
    This male paradigm for heroism or adventure is not diminished by the inclusion of female participants, because their participation as social men does not threaten the stability of the available models for heroism, adventure, or participation in public affairs. This is not to say that the conflation of the masculine and the general is complete or perfect. Silence is not just a woman whose disguise is good enough to pass for a while. Her exploits in several fields become famous and are much admired; her story raises the question of the degree to which all of the men out there are performing masculinity.
  </p>
<p>
    Hotchkiss points out that even though the available vocabulary for female adventure and heroism arises through a process of masculinization,
  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
      The exploits and virtues depicted, however, are obviously attributed to the women, creating a new type of female protagonist. An authorial uncertainty concerning gender behaviour admits this possibility of female heroism, albeit within the universality of the male paradigm of heroism.
    </p>
<div class="attrib">
      (p. 104)
    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Unlike medieval stage praxis, where passing as a member of the opposite sex requires work, medieval romances consistently emphasize the ease and naturalness of such passing. As Hotchkiss observes, ‘for literary characters, undetected disguise is part of the illusion of fiction’ (p. 11).
    </p>
<p>
      Silence’s <em>bialté</em> is constantly remarked upon after her transformation into a man, but it is a kind of attractiveness that is not specifically linked to femininity. This romance does not draw sharp distinctions between male and female beauty, as Silence conforms to one classic paradigm for male attractiveness in medieval French romance, being noble, young, blond, with fine nose and eyes, a lovely neck, and a beardless chin. Silence is seen as an attractive, beardless, blond youth. Wind and sun may darken Silence’s complexion <strong> [End Page 20] </strong>(much to the distress of Nature) but her body makes the female/male transition with apparent ease.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>18</sup></a>
    </p>
<p>
      Silence’s male disguise and her asexual beauty initially seem to avoid the danger not only of any attractiveness that is specifically female (and thus problematic for her disguise) but also of a vulnerability that is often specifically female in the world of romance as well, vulnerability to sexual violence. Silence, disguised as a man, travels alone with no fear. She is well able to defend herself, as witnessed by her displays of martial prowess at many points, most notably when she is recalled to England from France to fight in the war. And yet once again her escape is temporary. The initial impression that she manages to solve female sexual vulnerability with her disguise is not borne out in the text.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>19</sup></a> Despite her apparent invulnerability to physical assault, she gets sucked into a rape narrative, one in which she herself is thought to be a rapist. Bloch’s focus is on Silence as object of poetic envy –‘Silence’s autochthonous invention of herself makes her the object of universal desire’<a name="f20-text" href="#f20" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>20</sup></a> – but once again the frame can be moved beyond that of poetic language. Eufeme first fakes a sexual assault by Silence and later accuses her a second time of making continuous, and aggressive, unwelcome advances. Hotchkiss places the situation within a broader range of phenomena in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century French romances, in which ‘disguise not only inverts cultural gender roles but also confuses or reorients sexuality’.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>21</sup></a>
    </p>
<p>
      Again in parallel with <em>Lanval</em>, the Queen expresses doubts about Silence’s sexuality, wondering if the resisting Silence wants to be a monk or hermit (ironic in view of the fact that Eufeme is having an affair with a man who dresses as a nun) and asking whether Silence is ‘estables’ (‘normal’ or stable/normative (l. 3817)).<a name="f22-text" href="#f22" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>22</sup></a> This motif is repeated in lines 3935–48. The Queen’s rage at Silence’s rejection of her body is also a rage at homosexuality and Silence’s imagined contempt for women (‘il despist femes et desdaigne’ (l. 3940)), raising of course the issue of separate constitution(s) of gender identification and sexual orientation, and the apparently problematic <em>instability</em> of such constitution(s) – thus the inapplicability of discourses of stability. <strong> [End Page 21] </strong>
    </p>
<p>
      Eufeme’s lust and fury drive her to a form of sexual assault which has the later function in the text of leading to the physical penetration of Silence’s male disguise. There is a physical and somewhat masochistic confrontation between Eufeme and Silence in which Eufeme bloodies her own nose, tears her own hair, weeps, and rips up her clothes, while at the same time she ‘tient bien ferm le vallet sinple’ (‘keep[s] a firm hand on the wretched youth’ (l. 4085)). She is setting the stage for her husband’s arrival in the bedchamber. This is performative grief and gender performance at once — a scene within a scene, complete with props, make-up (blood) and audience. Eufeme’s persuasive ability depends on a conflation of female speech with deceptiveness and vengefulness, a superimposition that is especially interesting in the context of a poem deeply concerned with speech and silence.
    </p>
<p>
      Though Eufeme’s claim is false, the King believes it and Silence does not defend herself from the charge. Among the many things that remain unsaid in this poem is the possibility that it is not uncomplicatedly desirable to be married to Ebain, who is not merely initially unjust but subsequently sleazily politic and deceptive. With the Queen kneeling and bleeding at his feet, Ebain reacts with anxiety about his male honour – not just his own but, interestingly enough, Silence’s too. Brahney comments that Ebain ‘subscribes to a boys-will-be-boys attitude that participates in and perpetuates the abuse of women’.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>23</sup></a> He refuses to have Silence burned or hanged, as such a response would amount to an admission of sexual impropriety. He urges his wife to forget about it and pretend that the incident never happened. He sends Silence away to the court of the King of France, with a letter of introduction.
    </p>
<p>
      At the end of the poem, Eufeme is drawn and quartered while Silence is dressed again as a woman. The poem expresses no regrets – ‘Nus hom qui fust ne plainst Eufeme’ (‘No one was sorry for Eufeme’ (l. 6663)) – but it may suggest to the modern reader that Eufeme’s – and woman’s, perhaps, in a larger sense – situation is highly vulnerable. While Ebain does believe the attempted assault to have taken place, his response is pragmatic, as Heather Lloyd emphasizes.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>24</sup></a> Ebain wishes to avoid a scandal, and it is clear that had his wife actually been raped, she would be compromised to much the same extent as her rapist. The (apparent) fact that she holds off her assailant makes it possible for the King to control the situation through the organized management of silences.
    </p>
<p>
      Eufeme, however, is not content to be silent or silenced, terms that become increasingly interchangeable as the romance progresses. She substitutes a letter condemning Silence to death for the original letter of introduction ordered by <strong> [End Page 22] </strong>her husband, and Silence narrowly escapes this death sentence. Roche-Mahdi comments that

	The chaste female in male dress who does not reveal her sex recalls many popular accounts of holy virgins, saints and martyrs.

<p class="continued">
      Silence, while being punished with exile to the court of the King of France, assumes the familiar posture of an object of barter and exchange between men — a posture thematized by Gayle Rubin in an influential article.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>26</sup></a> At the same time, disguised as a man and allowed to participate fully in all forms of societally-sanctioned violence, Silence is pretty much exempt from the fear of rape, and in fact is viewed by her own King as a would-be rapist.

    </p>
<p>
      Lloyd argues that ‘in much of what happens to Silence [. . .] we tend to lose sight of the fact that she is a woman in disguise [. . .]. For much of the central part of the romance the fact that Silence is a woman in disguise is of little consequence to the story’.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>27</sup></a> It is not so much that we forget her true sex as that the ease of her passing is one of the most important fictions of the text, a seemingly ideal solution to female vulnerability both in economic and sexual terms. Ultimately, however, transvestism enables merely a deferral rather than a defeat of female vulnerability. Laura Mulvey’s work on female fantasies of masculinization is suggestive here, as she points to a ‘resistance, in which the power of masculinity can be used as a postponement against the power of patriarchy’.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>28</sup></a> Because Silence’s disguise can be penetrated (unlike Blanchandine, she is not really transformed into a man) her vulnerability remains intact.

      No lament attends the closing motions of the <em>Roman de Silence;</em> the war between nature and culture ends without a whimper. Silence’s marriage to Ebain takes place in tandem with a cascade of losses that are not represented as having anything to do with her subjectivity or experience: she loses her disguise, her voice and her property to Ebain. Her final words in the romance mark a surrender of self that is literalized with her subsequent silence:

    Silence can no longer keep silent, just as she ceases to speak. She becomes a function of Ebain, the rejected/abjected reunited with the rejecter. Silence as created character is unable to speak as a woman, just as the poem’s narrator soon asks, ‘Segnor, que vos diroie plus?’ (‘Lords, what more can I say?’ (l. 6665)), signalling, as Bloch puts it, that further ‘narrative progression’ is impossible (p. 87). Silence’s earlier dream of having a voice in captivity is not realized.

<p>
    Silence’s marriage to the King enforces a kind of compulsory heterosexuality that attempts to suppress the various dissenting voices of the poem, but the problem remains, in Brahney’s terms, that a great deal of the romance ‘constitutes an experiment yielding empirical data which demonstrate that, were she freed from the constraints of society, woman’s capacity for development would be unlimited’.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>29</sup></a> Noreture constantly argues that it would be much better for Silence to remain in her disguise as a man forever, and Silence comes to endorse and internalize many of these arguments. Noreture does an excellent job of convincing Silence that women’s lives are narrow and constrained, and that she should struggle to preserve the freedoms available to her as a man. At one point, the claim is made that for Silence to give up her disguise and take up a woman’s habits would be almost as bad as suicide:

  Silence’s final silent scene does much to underscore the fundamental truth of this claim, as she dies out of the narrative. She never revokes or <em>unsays</em> her rejection of the female world:

  Against a backdrop of scenes in which a woman’s life is depicted with images of incarceration and death, silence is ominous. <strong> [End Page 24] </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The execution of Eufeme provides an ugly background to the marriage of Ebain and Silence. The drawing and quartering and the marriage follow one another closely in the text, as Ebain disposes of one wife and ‘marries Silence, daughter of his own nephew and the woman whose name – Eufemie – differs by but one letter from that of his former wife’.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>30</sup></a> Reward and punishment are juxtaposed: on the one hand, marriage – a key theme throughout the romance, in which several marriages are granted as rewards – and on the other, death. Marriage and death become the two sides of the same coin. Though this is presented as another binary system (innocent/guilty, marriage/death, Silence/Eufeme, life/death), it is problematized by the inclusion of scenes in which a woman’s life is conflated with death. Eufeme acts out a female rebellion – an incorrect gender performance – that is punished with death, but as Roche-Mahdi comments: ‘by revealing that relations between the sexes are based on masking, the author has undercut the surface contrast between Silence and Eufeme as heroine and villainess before their ultimate confrontation’.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>31</sup></a> Marriage and death alike bring silence and an end to rebellion. The distinctness of terms is lost, just as it is when Nature and Noreture attempt to figure the nature/culture opposition as one between the raw and the cooked in the Merlin episode. Their claims become entangled and fall apart ideologically – Nature claims the cooked, Noreture the raw – and Merlin is so hungry and disoriented when he takes the meat that he does not make any distinction: ‘C’ainc ne demanda s’ele fu | Cuite u crue’ (‘He didn’t stop to ask whether it was | raw or cooked’ (ll.6113–14)).
</p>
<p>
  Judith Butler’s emphasis on the ways in which gender is constituted at the daily level offers a new insight into Silence’s performance of masculinity.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>32</sup></a> If gender is ‘an “act,” broadly construed, which constructs the social fiction of its own psychological interiority’ then the problem with Silence’s act is that it works too well and for too long.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>33</sup></a> Its sudden end seems not to provide closure but instead strikes the reader more as a punishment than a reward. The final scenes of the <em>Roman de Silence</em> align femininity with domestic space in an unproblematic manner, even though the romance as a whole offers little reason to view domestic space as unproblematic (or justly and benevolently regulated) or to think that Silence’s natural place is ‘in’ rather than ‘out’. An end to discourse – silence – does not quell the notion, convincingly developed at so many points throughout the romance, that ‘miols valt li us d’ome | Que l’us de feme, c’est la some’ (‘a man’s life | was much better than that of a woman’ (ll. 2637–38)). This is Silence speaking, not Noreture. <strong> [End Page 25] </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The overt message of Silence’s marriage to Ebain appears to be: Noreture may win many battles, but Nature inevitably wins the war. However, Nature’s victory is more a retirement from the field. Silence’s final disposition marks a closing-down of fictional possibilities that does much to reinforce all doubts about <em>l’us de feme</em> developed in the body of the romance. The poet’s final remarks draw attention to his poetic project of blaming bad women (such as Eufeme) and praising good women (such as Silence, in her silent, married incarnation). Our attention, in the end, devolves to the narrator and to the issue of what sorts of cultural fantasy may be represented in or through the closing motions of the poem. The romance does end with the punishment of the guilty, in several senses. Eufeme, of course, is executed, as is her cross-dressed lover (another incorrect gender performance punished with death). But Silence, too, is punished, with the very <em>bastonage</em> of her earlier fears, imprisoned beyond language and without voice. We are reminded thereby of the various ways in which she, too, is guilty – guilty of being the innocent victim of injustices, of deception, of destabilizing the categories of nature/culture, strong/weak, male/female, reward/punishment, in/out, and language/silence.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34" class="rid-fn-text"><sup>34</sup></a><strong> [End Page 26] </strong>

	  No other work, to our knowledge, is attributed to Heldris of Cornwall. Heinrich Gelzer argues that the name springs from Geoffrey of Monmouth and was picked for its connection with Cornwall via Cheldricus, a Saxon defeated by Cador, Duke of Cornwall in the <em>History of the Kings of Britain</em> (IX, 1–5). Roche-Mahdi describes this argument as convincing in a footnote in her edition of the poem and appears to concur that the name is in some sense made up.
