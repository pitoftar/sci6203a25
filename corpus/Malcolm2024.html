<p class="chapter-para">The last decade has witnessed rapid shifts in scholarship on trans and gender nonconforming experiences during the European Middle Ages. Despite initial concerns about such approaches being anachronistic or historically inaccurate, medievalists have begun to productively incorporate trans and intersex theory into their discussions of non-normative genders and sexualities.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en1"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en1" data-open="isae083-en1" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>1</sup></a> In fact, scholars of premodern gender are often explicit about their motivations beyond medieval studies, highlighting the benefits of transhistorical comparisons for marginalized communities today. For example, M. W. Bychowski suggests that readers should “become a pilgrim through trans history,” a practice that can make us “aware of our foreignness to the present moment of transgender”; to be a pilgrim is to acknowledge the limitations of one’s own perspective with respect to both current and past realities (Bychowski et al. 660–61). Similarly, Alicia Spencer-Hall and Blake Gutt present their edited collection on gender-variant saints as “offer[ing] historically grounded refutation of theological transphobia” (17). Studies in this vein suggest that uncovering a plurality of voices in the past can denaturalize modern gender norms and provide trans people with expanded senses of history and community.</p><p class="chapter-para">By emphasizing the political importance of transhistorical scholarship, premodern trans and intersex studies complement parallel work on race in the Middle Ages and its modern legacies (Heng; Miyashiro, “Deeper Past”; Rajabzadeh; Whitaker). In fact, race and gender are not easily separable concepts in medieval texts, which often portray non-Christian or non-European cultures as engaging in queer sexual practices or as “hermaphrodites” whose bodies defy binary gender (DeVun, <em>Shape of Sex</em> 40–69; Lehr; Oswald; Rivkin).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en2"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en2" data-open="isae083-en2" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, both race and gender are closely linked to medieval conceptions of animality. As Leah DeVun observes, “a binary and stable sex, a singular means of reproduction, and a restricted set of possible sexual acts were central to what made humans human” (“Animal Appetites” 462). Conversely, medieval writers animalized those whom they perceived as deviating from these norms, including members of racialized groups. Antisemitic stereotypes reveal the short distance between gender variance (e.g., accusations of androgyny; the fairly common idea that Jewish men menstruated) and animalization, with Jewish people being compared to owls, dogs, pigs, or goats (Goodrich 11–14; Heng 30, 72; Resnick). Antisemitism and transphobia converge with particular virulence in descriptions of the hyena, which was thought to change its sex, and which some texts aligned with “Jews’ purported effeminacy, fickleness, animality, and rejection of Christ” (Campbell, “Visualizing the Trans-Animal Body” 248; see also DeVun, <em>Shape of Sex</em> 70–101).</p><p class="chapter-para">These examples of the interplay of race, gender, and species in premodern texts illustrate both the amenability of such texts to intersectional approaches and their capacity to disrupt current readers’ assumptions about these categories. For example, medieval views often resonate with more modern forms of racialization, such as the “conjoined figurations of animality, race, and queerness” that Mel Y. Chen traces in early-twentieth-century American representations of Asian men (107). Yet the specific mechanisms through which identities were produced, described, and maintained differ among periods to a degree that may call activist strategies into question.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en3"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en3" data-open="isae083-en3" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>3</sup></a> As a result, medieval texts can broaden the burgeoning fields of queer and trans ecologies, which address the relations among ecological phenomena, gender variance, and queerness on material and conceptual levels.</p><p class="chapter-para">In this article, I contemplate how premodern ideas of gender and nonhuman nature might help one to imagine environmentally and socially just futures in the twenty-first century. I focus on the Old French <em>Roman de Silence</em> (Romance of Silence, henceforth <em>Silence</em>), a chivalric romance dating from the early thirteenth century and attributed to the otherwise unknown Heldris of Cornwall. Despite the recent growth of interest in this poem as a representation of trans experience, this poem is rarely read from an ecocritical perspective. Yet <em>Silence</em> depicts climate and gender as entangled, linking the eponymous protagonist Silence’s (trans)masculinity to their exposure to wind and heat.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en4"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en4" data-open="isae083-en4" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>4</sup></a> This poem illustrates how nonhuman nature could enable resistance to medieval gender binaries, even as it also provided metrics for categorizing humans. Through its meteorological and vegetal motifs, it also suggests expansions to concepts such as Nicole Seymour’s “organic transgenderism,” a literary “counter-discourse” in which gender transition is figured as “a spontaneous, noncommodified, and self-directed process likened to the life-cycle changes of plants and animals” (<em>Strange Natures</em> 30). Written long before modern medical models of transition, <em>Silence</em> depicts gender as emerging from interwoven organic, inorganic, and technical processes.</p><p class="chapter-para">This article contends that <em>Silence</em> depicts gender and species as unstable, intertwined, and more mutable than social class.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en5"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en5" data-open="isae083-en5" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>5</sup></a> I begin by exploring the poem’s emphasis on epidermal whiteness as a sign of both femininity and nobility. I then focus on the last section of the poem, in which the titular character undertakes a quest to find Merlin that leads to Silence’s forced integration into femininity. Silence’s interactions with Merlin, a prophet with a tenuous connection to human society, further undermine gender hierarchies without troubling the poem’s investments in lineage. I also address the ambiguous analogy that Merlin makes between Silence’s situation and a grafted plant, which I read as an emblem of both interspecies collaboration and trans thriving. As a whole, <em>Silence</em> exemplifies the interdependency and historical variability of gender and species concepts, revealing how medieval texts might help to unsettle modern paradigms.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination=535259505 id="535259505" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Climate, Whiteness, and Embodiment</h2>
<p class="chapter-para"><em>Silence</em> begins in an aristocratic English society that has recently been shaken by the deaths of two counts. These counts were married to twin sisters and killed each other in a quarrel over their wives’ inheritances, so the fictional King Ebain decrees that women will no longer inherit property in England. When Eufemie and Cador, the earl and countess of Cornwall, are expecting a child several years later, they resolve to evade Ebain’s edict by raising the child as a boy regardless of their assignation at birth.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en6"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en6" data-open="isae083-en6" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>6</sup></a> The child, Silence, is born with only a trusted cousin attending, and though the poet declares them to be “une puchiele” (a girl; 1798), Eufemie and Cador publicly present them as a boy before sending them to live in the woods with a loyal seneschal.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en7"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en7" data-open="isae083-en7" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus shielded from the public eye, Silence grows into a model of chivalric masculinity—impressing women with their appearance (2513–15), delighting their parents with their comportment (2391–406), and outstripping all of their peers in wrestling and jousting (2494–96). When they are twelve years old, an encounter with the allegorical figures of Nature, Nurture, and Reason prompts them to leave with a pair of traveling minstrels. After three years of wandering, Silence returns to England and enters King Ebain’s service, whereupon Queen Eufeme attempts to seduce them. Silence’s rejection of the queen incites a chain of events that culminate in a quest to find Merlin and Silence being stripped naked in court.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en8"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en8" data-open="isae083-en8" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>8</sup></a> The romance ends with Ebain marrying Silence and repealing his decree, allowing women to inherit again.</p><p class="chapter-para">Although Silence is thus assigned both male and female on their first day of life, and it is their parents who elect to raise them as a boy, their explicit self-identification with masculinity has inspired interpretations of them as a trans figure.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en9"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en9" data-open="isae083-en9" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>9</sup></a> Granted, early analyses tended to place this text within a tradition of “transvestite romances,” or “stories of women who dress and act as men” (McCracken 517), while the growth of queer medieval studies at the turn of the twenty-first century led other scholars to favor queer readings at the expense of potential trans ones (Blumreich; Waters). Still, scholars often conveyed dissatisfaction with “transvestite” readings of this text even before trans theory entered the conversation, noting that that it fundamentally disrupts binary notions of gender.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en10"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en10" data-open="isae083-en10" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>10</sup></a> Perhaps most strikingly, Erin Labbie identifies Silence with a “third gender” whose identity emerges from a “constant process of becoming” (66, 76), a phrase evoking modern theories that describe gender transition in similar terms (Braidotti; Garner; Sullivan). Recent years have seen the emergence of self-consciously trans readings of the poem, such as Caitlin Watt’s careful study of Silence as both a potential trans man and a chivalric hero. Rather than assuming that Silence is a woman dressed as a man, these approaches attend to the precise ways in which Silence and other characters define, describe, and question their gender in relation to social norms.</p><p class="chapter-para">Silence’s gender has thus drawn consistent interest and will likely continue to do so; for instance, Campbell’s comparison of <em>Silence</em> to hagiographies (“Translating Gender”) usefully intersects with recent work on “trans saints” (Spencer-Hall and Gutt). Yet the poem has attracted less attention from ecocritics, with only a few scholars touching on its depictions of wilderness (Barr; Griffin)—and at first glance, <em>Silence</em> appears a poor candidate for such readings due to the paucity of its direct references to nonhuman life. Its personified Nature seems to vary in her specific meanings throughout the poem but generally represents what is standard or innate for humans rather than aspects of the nonhuman world (Krueger 57; Newman 125–134; Watt 147–48). Her debate with Nurture evokes but ultimately resists comparison with the notion of a divide between nature and culture; as Jessica Barr points out, it is most accurate to place both Nature and Nurture on the “culture” side of this binary, since “both participate in the patriarchal structure of Ebain’s rule” and “Nurture simply seeks to assign Silence a different role within that structure” (8). Landscapes and nonhuman creatures are described in passing, if at all, and articles focusing on the poem’s nonhuman spaces have tended to treat these not as specific ecosystems but as nebulous wilderness. Thus for Barr, the <em>bos</em> (woods or wilderness) represents the breakdown of patriarchal society and gendered expectations, although Ebain’s control is reasserted at the poem’s end (7–12).</p><p class="chapter-para">While Barr’s analysis of the <em>bos</em> is compelling, I find it crucial to trace some of the subtler ways in which nonhuman nature shapes the poem’s characters, as these offer further insight into both the poem and its resonances with contemporary theory. Despite its depictions of wilderness spaces as isolated from human influence, many moments in the text work against this implied nature/culture divide by suggesting that the “wild” impacts humans and their societies. <em>Silence</em> is especially preoccupied with the human body’s susceptibility to environmental factors, a concern that brings it in line with recent materialist ecocriticism. Indeed, both environmental humanists and trans theorists have called attention to the less-perceptible presences of natural materials and nonhuman animals in human bodies, as well as in settings that seem predominantly anthropogenic or cultural. Examples include Stacy Alaimo’s theory of “trans-corporeality,” wherein “the human is always intermeshed with the more-than-human world” through the flows of physical materials (2); while Alaimo did not originally link this concept to trans embodiment, trans-corporeality resonates with incisive work that explores trans identities in relation to nonhuman species and even ecological contamination (Hayward; Straube).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en11"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en11" data-open="isae083-en11" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p class="chapter-para">Medieval physicians may not have found these theories groundbreaking. Humoral medicine treated the intermeshment of humans with their surroundings as a first principle, attributing aspects of a person’s character—often including their gender identity and expression—to the presence and movements of materials through their body. To drastically simplify a complex group of theories and practices, Galenic humorism held that an individual’s constitution was shaped by a unique mixture of hot, cold, wet, and dry bodily fluids, with imbalances of these humors producing diseases and behavioral changes. Although men were generally considered to have hotter and drier bodies than women, the traditional Hippocratic or Galenic model tended to portray gender as a spectrum along which an individual could move, typically by ingesting or otherwise coming into contact with substances that altered their chemical makeup (Cadden 201–7; Miles and Seal; Watt 142–43).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en12"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en12" data-open="isae083-en12" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>12</sup></a> Because social hierarchies such as gender and race were linked to the physical composition of particular bodies, these hierarchies could sometimes break down as materials flowed across humans and the surrounding terrain.</p><p class="chapter-para">In <em>Silence</em>, whiteness often serves as an index of such material changes. Early in the poem, readers are treated to a long scene in which Nature shapes the unborn Silence’s body using her best clay, which she reserves for people of noble birth. Breaking from the standard medieval convention of depicting Nature as a smith who forges the bodies of living creatures (Robertson 64–72; Truitt 40–47), Heldris compares her to a baker:<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en13"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en13" data-open="isae083-en13" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>13</sup></a><div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">Tolt si com cil qui prent un crible,</div><div class="verse-line">U tamis, u un buletiel,</div><div class="verse-line">Quant faire violt blanc pain e biel,</div><div class="verse-line">Et quant la farine i a mise</div><div class="verse-line">Dunt crible, u bulette, u tamise,</div><div class="verse-line">Et torne le flor d’une part,</div><div class="verse-line">Et le gros terchuel en depart,</div><div class="verse-line">Et fait adonc un entreclos</div><div class="verse-line">Entre le fleur blance et le gros</div><div class="verse-line">[……………………………]</div><div class="verse-line">Si fait Nature, c’est la some,</div><div class="verse-line">Quante faire violt un vallant home</div><div class="verse-line">Que voelle ovrer par majestyre.</div><div class="verse-line">[……………………………]</div><div class="verse-line">De cel delié si fait sans falle</div><div class="verse-line">Les buens, et del gros la frapalle.

These faults have physiological and psychological effects, as coarse material acts directly on the “cuer” (heart), which in turn alters an individual’s “corage” (character, mind, or spirit).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en15"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en15" data-open="isae083-en15" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>15</sup></a></p><p class="chapter-para">This passage sets the tone for the poem’s many comments on the whiteness of Silence’s body and its variable associations. Here, it is crucial to note the complexity of medieval views on epidermal whiteness—which, as Wan-Chuan Kao has recently argued, are not straightforward analogues of later conceptions of whiteness as a racial marker. While Kao finds that “there is no consistent, immutable correlation between colour and premodern race,” he acknowledges that the European Middle Ages witnessed a “hardening of the black-white binary” that began to resemble modern race concepts (6–7).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en16"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en16" data-open="isae083-en16" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>16</sup></a> In fact, whiteness cut across several identity frameworks and could represent a range of “cultural ideals such as courtly beauty, Christian salvation, chivalric prowess, social ethics or European identity,” while dark skin was generally associated not only with non-Christian religious identities but also with the lower classes (Kao 8). Many classical and medieval writers also linked skin color to climate, understanding a person’s visual appearance and character to be shaped by environmental factors (Miyashiro, “Race, Environment, Culture”).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en17"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en17" data-open="isae083-en17" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>17</sup></a> Epidermal whiteness thus reflects what Geraldine Heng has called “the ability of racial logic to stalk and merge with other hierarchical systems—such as class, gender, or sexuality” (20), producing complex intersections that cannot, as Mariah Min has argued, be subsumed under a singular notion of “medieval race.”</p><p class="chapter-para">Citing DiAngelo’s concept of “white fragility,” Kao also observes that many premodern European writers depicted whiteness as fragile and precarious; this depiction, in turn, heightened the associations of whiteness with courtliness, as both were characterized by a “solipsistic love of fragility” (76). Indeed, while many of the above associations—femininity, nobility, climate—are clear throughout <em>Silence’</em>s numerous references to whiteness, it is this last point about fragility that drives the narrative.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en18"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en18" data-open="isae083-en18" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>18</sup></a> Silence’s whiteness comes under threat from the first day of their life, with their father planning to raise them as a boy by exposing them to different climatic forces. He proposes that Silence “ira al vent et al halle,/A la froidure et a la bize” (will wander in wind and scorching sun,/in freezing cold and [northerly] breeze) before even mentioning giving them a masculine hairstyle or clothing (2052–56). Sure enough, the seneschal tasked with Silence’s education<div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">Le mainne en bos et en rivieres</div><div class="verse-line">Ki sunt el païs bien plenieres.</div><div class="verse-line">Sel mainne plus sovent el halle</div><div class="verse-line">Par cho quel violt faire plus malle.</div><div class="verse-line">Il a us d’ome tant usé</div><div class="verse-line">Et cel de feme refusé</div><div class="verse-line">Que poi en falt que il n’est malles.

Thus <em>Silence</em> implicitly presents gender as fluid by relating it to environmental factors, while the halle/malle end-rhyme—a recurrent motif in the poem—emphasizes the Galenic association between heat and masculinity.</p><p class="chapter-para">These extreme temperatures produce gendered changes in Silence’s body, which grows weathered as they age, their skin darkening (2827–28) and their mouth and arms hardening (2646–47). In this respect, <em>Silence</em> calls to mind the medieval tendency that François⋅e Charmaille calls “trans climatology,” or the “conceptualization of seasons as gendered, of the climatically ordered procession of the seasons as transgender change, and of this change having a direct effect on the bodies of people” (“Trans Climates” 698). In the texts Charmaille considers, weather and seasonality not only produce gendered effects but are also themselves gendered, and seasonal change is figured as transition. Consequently, these texts present “transition as a potentially universal phenomenon” and a fundamental property of local climates (Charmaille, “Trans Climates” 698, 726). While <em>Silence</em> does not extensively describe seasonal change or personify the seasons, Charmaille’s work is useful in that it expands beyond certain “trans ecologies” frameworks derived from modern texts, such as Seymour’s “organic transgenderism,” to foreground the trans possibilities of <em>in</em>organic nonhuman nature (Charmaille, “Trans Climates” 697–98). The gendering effects of the sun and wind are indeed a “potentially universal phenomenon” in <em>Silence</em>: even though the poem treats Silence’s experiences as unusual, it also raises the possibility of others undergoing bodily changes through exposure to the outdoors. Despite the fact that Nurture claims Silence’s transition as her own work, the meteorological conditions underlying it are natural and ever-present.</p><p class="chapter-para">These climate-induced changes contrast with another shift in Silence’s complexion, which occurs after the appearance of Nature, Nurture, and Reason. In their ensuing debate, Nature demands that Silence alter their appearance and lifestyle to appear more feminine, while Nurture demurs and Reason argues that masculinity offers more social advantages. Silence ends the discussion by affirming that “vallés sui et nient mescine” (I am a young man and not a girl; 2650), but the interaction has planted a seed of anxiety about being forced to set aside their military training to live as a woman. In anticipation of this possibility, they decide to acquire skills better suited to courtly women, leading them to pursue a musical education by running away with a pair of minstrels. Undeterred after the minstrels initially reject them, Silence darkens their face and follows the minstrels to a departing boat:<div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">D’une herbe qu’ens el bos a prise</div><div class="verse-line">Desconoist sa face et deguise.</div><div class="verse-line">Ki bien l’esgarde viers le chiere</div><div class="verse-line">Bien sanble de povre riviere. (2909–12)</div><div class="verse-line">(he stained and disguised his face</div><div class="verse-line">with a herb he found in the woods.</div><div class="verse-line">Whoever looked at his complexion</div><div class="verse-line">would certainly think him [from a poor stream].)</div></div></p><p class="chapter-para">In keeping with Jessica Barr’s argument, the <em>bos</em> permits the disruption of social norms: Silence uses a herb sourced therein to color their face, an act that reinforces the poem’s association of darker bodies with lower social status. Yet their disguise is not even skin deep. The minstrels quickly see through it to Silence’s “natural” complexion, a mixture of lily-white and rose-red (2976–78). Although Nature uses similar language in an earlier invective against Silence’s masculine gender performance, identifying this mixture of red and white as a feminine trait that their sunburn obscures (2280–91), Silence’s complexion is here taken as a sign of noble birth; they are dark enough to be a man but not dark enough to be a peasant.</p><p class="chapter-para">Considered together, these passages suggest that gender might change during a person’s lifetime, whereas class may only be concealed (see further Clark 56–57). Despite their other transformations, Silence is consistently portrayed as the pinnacle of aristocratic values: they are physically beautiful, fearless in battle, and so charming that the King of France neglects to execute them despite a letter (purportedly from Ebain but forged by Queen Eufeme) urging him to do so. Importantly, however, the poem also links the stability of social rank and the flexibility of gender performance to nonhuman nature—to weather (which enacts lasting bodily changes) and a weed (which is only applied topically and has only surface-level effects).</p><p class="chapter-para">This poem thus presents a system of whiteness, gender, class, and the nonhuman that may be quite unfamiliar to modern readers but that complements modern trans theory. For instance, many scholars have commented on the processes through which white, wealthy, and/or masculine trans people achieve legitimacy at the expense of trans women of color (Gill-Peterson; Seymour, “Good Animals” 198–200; Snorton 139–75; Stryker). Medieval whiteness highlights such intersections to an equal or even greater degree. In spite of Nature’s complaints about their altered skin, Silence’s masculinity is rarely challenged because they fulfill many of the “cultural ideals” that Kao ties to whiteness—beauty, military skills, personal ethics, and an aristocratic lineage. In fact, their initial fairness arguably enables their transition given how straightforwardly the sun acts upon them, whereas Nature must intervene directly to lighten their skin at the end. In this reading, <em>Silence</em> presents not a general vision of trans possibility, but a specific account of the movement of a high-born white individual toward masculinity. The poem may therefore imply that transition is less achievable for who are not born into whiteness and privilege, such as racially marked figures and the lower classes.</p><p class="chapter-para">Although the imbrications of gender, race, and class thus emerge quite differently in <em>Silence</em> than they do in contemporary societies, they can call attention to analogous intersections today. In the following section, I will continue to explore these imbrications via the parallels between Silence and Merlin, whose reintegration into society results in Silence being forced to assume a feminine social role.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination=535259523 id="535259523" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" >Transplants and Trans Plants</h2>
<p class="chapter-para">Near the end of <em>Silence</em>, Eufeme and Ebain send Silence to retrieve Merlin from where he has been living in the woods; Eufeme views this as an impossible errand, as it is said that Merlin can only be captured by a “woman’s trick” (5803).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en19"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en19" data-open="isae083-en19" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>19</sup></a> After traveling for a few months, Silence meets an old man (often interpreted as Merlin in disguise) who helps them set up a trail of food and wine as bait.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en20"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en20" data-open="isae083-en20" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>20</sup></a> The old man predicts that Merlin will not be able to resist this feast after years of surviving on herbs and roots, foods more appropriate for animals than for humans. He tells Silence that Merlin will be drawn by the smell of the meat “s’il a humanité en lui” (if there is any [humanity] left in him; 5955) and will then fall asleep after drinking the wine. Sure enough, despite opposition from Nurture, Nature pushes Merlin toward the food so quickly that he that he tears through a bramble patch (6090–96). Although he does return to human society, this episode thus presents Merlin’s species identity as contested, and perhaps even contingent on the food that he consumes.</p><p class="chapter-para">When Silence subsequently brings Merlin to court, Merlin claims that Silence is a “meschine” (6536) and reveals that a nun present is Eufeme’s lover (ostensibly a man) in disguise. Ebain has Silence and the nun publicly undressed and executes the adulterers before proposing marriage to Silence, who fulfills their name by never speaking again in the poem. Nature then spends three days removing the effects of sun and heat from Silence’s body:<div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">D’illuec al tierc jor que Nature</div><div class="verse-line">Ot recovree sa droiture</div><div class="verse-line">Si prist Nature a repolir</div><div class="verse-line">Par tolt le cors et a tolir</div><div class="verse-line">Tolt quanque ot sor le cors de malle.</div><div class="verse-line">Ainc n’i lassa nes point de halle:</div><div class="verse-line">Remariä lués en so&lt;n v&gt;is</div><div class="verse-line">Assisement le roze al lis.

I am not the first to propose this comparison; for instance, in a salient analysis of materiality and gender, Barbara Newman notes that the foods that alter Merlin’s humoral balance and enable his return to human society are “coded both masculine and feminine: roast meat and wine evoke the warriors’ banquet hall, milk and honey the female body” (131).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en22"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en22" data-open="isae083-en22" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>22</sup></a> However, I wish to make two additional points about the similarities between these characters. First, having considered Silence’s complicated self-identification as a “vallés,” one might note that Merlin also seems to recognize himself as operating beyond conventional categories. Specifically, the old man who speaks with Silence compares Merlin to forest animals:<div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">Cho est uns hom trestols pelus</div><div class="verse-line">Et si est com uns ors velus;</div><div class="verse-line">Si est isnials com cers de lande.</div><div class="verse-line">Herbe, rachine est sa viände.

Merlin’s hair and diet attest to the physiological impacts of his lifestyle; inhabiting the woods has transformed his body, making him more animalistic on a literal level as well as a figurative one. As Robert Sturges argues (49–50), even the meat incident is ambivalent, given the tension implicit in Merlin’s uncontrollable appetite (which for medieval scholastic philosophers was characteristic of animals lacking reason) for cooked meat (the characteristic diet of humans).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en24"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en24" data-open="isae083-en24" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>24</sup></a></p><p class="chapter-para">My second point picks up on Mel Y. Chen’s understanding of the “animacy hierarchies” through which humans seek to order and control other humans, nonhuman life, and nonliving material; these are conceptual “scale[s] of relative sentience that plac[e] humans at the very top” but do not treat all humans equally (89).<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en25"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en25" data-open="isae083-en25" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>25</sup></a> Chen attends to the biopolitical structures that contain “improper affiliation[s]” (104) by excluding queer and trans people—along with people of color and disabled people—from full participation in humanity, aligning them with nonhuman animals. Yet these “queer” forms of animacy (104) remain a constant threat to the social order, enabling marginalized people to gain power by transgressing social hierarchies.</p><p class="chapter-para">To adopt this language, both Merlin and Silence derive status and recognition from their transgressions of animacy hierarchies, if only temporarily. It is clear throughout the poem that Silence not only benefits from performing masculinity but also excels at this performance beyond all of their presumably cis peers—from childhood (2396–99) to knighthood, surpassing all others in the region during their stint in France (5209–10). Similarly, Merlin’s outsider position allows him to occupy the role of “a Wild Man who prophesies and admirably privileges ‘truth’” (Stock, “Civilization and Its Discontents” 23). From his (likely) scheme to capture himself to the secret knowledge that he reveals upon returning to court (e.g., Merlin laughs at beggars who are unaware of the treasure buried beneath their feet; 6202–9, 6330–40), his insight is remarkable and often supernatural. In other words, these characters excel at the very things that their liminal status might seem to preclude. Silence is not a cis man, but they are particularly good at the martial skills associated with men, while Merlin acts like an animal lacking reason, but his knowledge exceeds the normal purview of human reason. In crossing gender and species boundaries, these characters also thoroughly destabilize binaristic and hierarchical views of these categories.</p><p class="chapter-para">The Merlin narrative in <em>Silence</em> also includes an image that unites many of the ideas I have expressed thus far. As he scrutinizes Silence during their conversation, the mysterious old man posits that happiness may arise from Silence’s troubles, much like how a graft may be added to a tree:<div class="verse-group"><div class="verse-line">Jo ai veü jadis enter</div><div class="verse-line">Sovent sor sur estoc dolce ente,</div><div class="verse-line">Par tel engien et tele entente</div><div class="verse-line">Que li estos et li surece</div><div class="verse-line">Escrut trestolt puis en haltece.</div><div class="verse-line">Alsi pora en ceste voie</div><div class="verse-line">Sor vostre dol naistre tels joie</div><div class="verse-line">Ki tolte amenrira encore</div><div class="verse-line">La dolor que vos avés ore.

Merlin’s comment also resonates with theories of gender transition as a creative, skillful process of self-shaping with joy or euphoria as the goal—a “form of technical thinking” that often depends on skill-sharing networks beyond medical institutions (Gordon, “Woman’s Prick” 270). The grafted plant represents a body reshaped via skill and purpose, ingenuity and desire; its transformation is both “organic,” to build on Seymour’s term, and technical. The scion that is added to the tree also has phallic connotations, even evoking the skin grafts used in modern phalloplasty and metoidioplasty.<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-isae083-en29"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="isae083-en29" data-open="isae083-en29" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-fn js-xref-fn"><sup>29</sup></a></p><p class="chapter-para">Taking inspiration from Kathleen Coyne Kelly’s analysis of grafting as enabling a “cross-species erotic” in the thirteenth-century <em>Roman de la Rose</em> (158), I see the grafted plant in <em>Silence</em> as suggesting that gender, like sexuality, might develop through more-than-human relations. This passage complements what Vin Nardizzi has called “trans<em>plant</em> poetics” or “representations of human embodiment in which plant figures <em>trans</em> that body’s perceived gender presentation” (158). Specifically, the transplant or graft in <em>Silence</em> produces a <em>trans plant</em>, a species that is created via prosthesis and flourishes as a result of human changes to “nature.” This plant suggests an understanding of gender transition as neither purely “natural” nor purely “social,” but rather as an organic-inorganic-technical process, emerging from the messy and multidirectional interactions among humans and other members of their ecosystems.</p><p class="chapter-para">For readers today, the grafted plant might also figure the benefits of bringing modern ideas of gender, species, race, and class to bear on premodern texts and vice versa. Although Silence and Merlin are eventually reabsorbed into patriarchal society, they enable readers to imagine systemic disruptions of hegemonic frameworks—to conceptualize how humans might resist repressive categorization by reshaping themselves and/with other species. Medieval poetry often valorizes individuals who shift among genders and species, envisioning non-normative possibilities even when conventional hierarchies are re-established at the end of a narrative. <em>Silence</em> in particular attests to how medieval texts could treat gender transition as inherent to natural systems; how whiteness develops clusters of meanings that are historically specific but consistently central to social hierarchies; and how the stability of some of these hierarchies (e.g., class) enables mobility in others. Ultimately, texts like <em>Silence</em> can expose both the roots of modern gender norms and their contingency. By grafting premodern perspectives onto contemporary ones, humans grow toward greater knowledge of themselves and their possible futures.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination=535259535 id="535259535" class="backsection-title js-splitscreen-backsection-title" >Notes</h2>
