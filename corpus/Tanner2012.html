<p>In the contrasting lives and fates of the rulers, husbands, vassals, and wives, and through the use of ambiguity and the manipulation of gender stereotypes in the Roman de Silence, Heldris of de Cornüalle offers a model of political and personal lordship which is founded upon consultation, consent, and self-restraint. When superiors, be they lords or husbands, provide an environment for the sharing of wisdom, both home and court nurture loyalty, good service, true liberality, and peace in vassals and wives. While Heldris's portrayal of the characteristics of good lordship is in many senses conventional, his hero(ine) and the parallels he draws between lordship and marriage affirm a very unconventional notion that women should play an active role in both governance and marriage.</p>

<p>After remaining in the shadows for many years, Heldris de Cornuälle's <em>Roman de Silence</em> has recently been drawn into the spotlight, as scholars of literature have explored the poem's tantalizingly ambiguous portrayal of gender.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1" class="rid-fn-text">1</a></sup> Although the text is becoming increasingly well known among literary scholars, it has not yet been widely utilized by historians. For those who have not had the pleasure of reading this tale, here is Sharon Kinoshita's admirably succinct outline of the plot, "Heldris de Cornuälle recounts the adventures of a heroine named Silence. Born at a time when women are barred from inheritance, she is brought up as a boy, winning great renown as a knight and a jongleur, to the gratification of Nurture and the consternation of Nature. Because Silence spurns the amorous advances of queen Eufeme, 'he' is twice accused of attempted rape and banished from court. In the end, however, her sex is revealed, and following the execution of the adulterous queen, Silence is married to the king, in a union acclaimed by the court."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The romance raises many ideas and themes, and as a political historian I was struck by the author's use of gender imagery in exploring the nature of lordship. The literary scholars Lorraine Stock, Peggy McCracken, and Sharon Kinoshita have examined elements of this theme, but I would like to expand upon their interpretations. In her male guise, Silence is the quintessential noble, and her interactions with the English and French kings develop the poet's conception of good political lordship. In the conflicting depictions of women's capabilities and nature in Eufemie (Silence's mother), Eufeme (the queen), and Silence, the author advances an argument about the parallel elements of good marriage. While Heldris's portrayal of the<strong> [End Page 138] </strong> characteristics of good lordship—liberality, bravery, justice, and consultation—is in many senses conventional, his hero(ine) and the parallels he draws between lordship and marriage affirm the very unconventional notion that women should play an active role in both governance and marriage.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to lordship, the poet uses gender explicitly and implicitly to examine a wide variety of issues in the course of the text: poetics, the nature of gender, language, silence, and interpretation. The literary scholars Peter Allen and R. Howard Bloch have argued that each of these discussions in the poem is marked by ambiguity and that the text is all about "misreading" and its author's refusal to offer definitive answers to the questions that the text raises.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text">4</a></sup> The ambiguities in the text have led to widely divergent assessments of whether the poet is advocating a conventionally misogynistic or proto-feminist view of women's nature and abilities. The literary scholars Kathleen Brahney and Anita Lasry have argued that the romance offers a positive view of women's capabilities through the author's portrayal of the performative nature of gender.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5" class="rid-fn-text">5</a></sup> The literary scholars Simon Gaunt, Caroline Jewers, Michèle Perret, Gloria Gilmore, and Peggy McCracken see it differently; despite the author's exploration of the role society plays in the defining of gender, the affirmation of nature over nurture at the end of the tale reveals the essentially conservative nature of the author's views of women's roles and nature.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6" class="rid-fn-text">6</a></sup> But as the literary scholar Regina Psaki has argued, "the ending does not negate or neutralize the radical events that preceded it. The universe remains disturbed: commonplaces about biological and social gender have still been shaken, and the pat ending with its pat commentary do not successfully repair the rift in this conceptual fabric."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7" class="rid-fn-text">7</a></sup> While the poet does not explicitly advocate women's equality to men, I agree with Psaki that the romance has shown its audience that women are quite capable of exercising power well—and that, even if men generally wield power, there is no need to bar women from inheritance or lordship.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8" class="rid-fn-text">8</a></sup></p>
<p>This rift or ambiguity in the conceptual fabric is not there just to convince the audience of the ultimate inability of humans to understand, as Bloch and Allen have argued; rather, it seems to serve a didactic purpose.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9" class="rid-fn-text">9</a></sup> The literary scholar Suzanne Kocher has argued that the numerous examples of misinterpretation by the poem's characters and narrator are the means by which the author teaches "the audience how to read, hear and understand . . . .The text encourages its audiences to practice the lessons it teaches, and to take part in an always incomplete process of making meaning from its complex juxtaposition of what is said and what is shown, what is stated and what is kept silent."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10" class="rid-fn-text">10</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the principal themes that Heldris uses to teach the process of nterpretation is that of lordship. The poet's fictional portrayal of the exclusion<strong> [End Page 139] </strong> of female inheritance allows him and his contemporaries to explore the nature both of gender and of good lordship. The nexus of land and power (or lordship) was the most important key to maintaining the nobles' role and status, and these were threatened by kings' increasing powers to regulate the transmission of property through law and feudo-vassalic ties in the thirteenth century. Nor is it surprising that a romance would be a vehicle to discuss the implications of the changing nature of royal power.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11" class="rid-fn-text">11</a></sup> McCracken argues that "the mutability of Silence's body reveals the role of political and social institutions in maintaining a binary gender system," necessary to ensure familial succession to property.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12" class="rid-fn-text">12</a></sup> Kinoshita has linked the text's gender politics to the thirteenth-century changes in "the feudal institutions of marriage, lineage, and the transmission of property" and particularly to the shift of the basis of the nobility's role from that of military service to one of genealogical reproduction.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13" class="rid-fn-text">13</a></sup> Both McCracken and Kinoshita see the tale as reaffirming patriarchy, the silencing of women, and their exclusion from power. Lorraine Stock, however, persuasively argues:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>the <em>Roman de Silence</em> exposes how power is allocated to and appropriated by <em>both</em> genders . . . .While Heldris presents male representatives of patriarchal political authority as mutual foils, the text also plays them against its female characters, who, as wives of rulers, also possess and exercise various types of power . . . .Merlin's revelations [at the end of the tale] undermine any reliable model of gendered power and invite questioning of the presumed male gender of the otherwise unknown author, who voices provocative questions about the gendering of the roles played and the power possessed by females and males in medieval society. Heldris's romance resists, destabilizes, and subverts the patriarchal silencing of feminine power typical of medieval literary texts.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14" class="rid-fn-text">14</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Building upon Stock's thesis that Heldris undermines the gendering of power and McCracken's and Kinoshita's position that the romance is specifically addressing the changing contours of royal and noble power, what model of good lordship in politics and marriage does Heldris offer?</p>
<p>In Heldris's model, the crux of good lordship is creating an environment that fosters good lords, vassals, husbands, and wives. While nature provides the essential traits, it is nurture that determines how one acts. And it's one's actions that reveal one's true character. Or as it states in the romance: "Good habits are a sign of a good life."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15" class="rid-fn-text">15</a></sup> All the main characters in the tale are well born (i.e. of noble lineage), but it is their upbringing and the environment provided at court (the two contexts of nurture) that reveal their character and thus, their ability to be a good lord or vassal. For the author,<strong> [End Page 140] </strong> discretion is a useful skill but the absence of good counsel—silence—is a key cause of failure in governance and in marriage.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16" class="rid-fn-text">16</a></sup> Both parties, lord and vassal, husband and wife, share the responsibility of communicating wisdom. Political and personal lordship thus requires first and foremost consultation and truthfulness. Self-discipline is the other key. Regulation of one's emotions is necessary to ensure justice. If one has true consultation and self-restraint, then the court and home provide the nurture that leads to loyalty, good service, true liberality, and consensus which in turn allows peace and good governance to flourish.</p>
<p>Although the narrator's prologue is often seen as an anti-prologue, since it seemingly fails to offer an interpretative guide to the romance, it in fact introduces both the theme of lordship and the importance of counsel and discretion. The narrator's introductory complaint about parsimonious patrons is not a digression but rather a signal to the contemporary audience that lordship will be a central theme of the story. Liberality—the lord as ring-giver—had long been a key component of good lordship; good lords give "spontaneously, joyously and without calculation."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17" class="rid-fn-text">17</a></sup> On the other hand, the gifts of avaricious lords "look like payments or bribes, rather than gifts; the relations they establish are, in F.G. Bailey's terms, purely 'transactional,' not 'moral' in that they entail only balanced exchanges of finite wealth for specific services which must be rendered in full."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18" class="rid-fn-text">18</a></sup> Although the narrator praises King Ebain as a generous lord this evaluation is undermined by the narrator's own description of Ebain's behavior and events within the narrative.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19" class="rid-fn-text">19</a></sup> The narrator describes Ebain's liberality as given freely for his men's service, but he then indicates that his gifts required a quid pro quo: "He enriched all his friends and placed them in positions of great honor, <em>so that</em> when the hour of greatest need came, they got him out of any trouble."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20" class="rid-fn-text">20</a></sup> This overt reference to the utilitarian nature of the king's liberality is substantiated by the adventure with the dragon in the forest of Malroi. Unwilling to tackle the dragon himself, Ebain offers an earldom and a bride to whoever kills the dragon.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21" class="rid-fn-text">21</a></sup> His calculating spirit is further evidenced when discussing with his nobles Cador's reward for slaying the dragon. Ebain wants one of them to convince Cador to accept Ebain's choice of bride (Eufemie) rather than let Cador choose his own bride as promised.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22" class="rid-fn-text">22</a></sup> The Count of Chester takes on this task, "heartily praying to Saint Amant to create such love between them that they would not protest the king's proposal."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23" class="rid-fn-text">23</a></sup> The count's pious hope reveals the king's lack of fidelity and generosity, despite the nobles' assertion that the king had spoken "like a loyal man."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24" class="rid-fn-text">24</a></sup> The prologue's long complaint over the lack of liberality at most courts concludes with the narrator stating that he wants to tell his story "without quarreling or fussing."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25" class="rid-fn-text">25</a></sup> As Kocher has pointed out, the whole prologue has been full of noise and contentiousness (a preview of<strong> [End Page 141] </strong> the character of Ebain's lordship), and the audience is given its first hint that the narrator's judgment is questionable and that ultimately he lacks the hero(ine)'s discretion and wisdom.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26" class="rid-fn-text">26</a></sup></p>
<p>This narrative ambiguity or gap, between what the action shows and the pronounced judgment of the narrator or common wisdom, is used consistently by the poet to portray Ebain as a bad lord. Although the narrator asserts that King Ebain is second only to Arthur, the poet demonstrates that the king is at times avaricious, unjust, uncontrolled, and injudicious. This depiction develops, in part, through playing with gender expectations. Lorraine Stock has shown how Ebain's masculinity and his power are undercut by the destablizing of his gender—it is he and not a damsel who needs rescuing from the dragon; it is Ebain who is capricious and unreasonable, like a stereotypical woman.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27" class="rid-fn-text">27</a></sup> Ebain's failure to engender an heir and his need for the superior physical prowess of Cador and Silence to rescue him from the dragon and the Count of Chester's rebellion, respectively, also feminize him.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28" class="rid-fn-text">28</a></sup> The prologue and the opening scenes of the romance thus begin to establish the contours of bad lordship—avariciousness, injustice, cowardice, and high-handedness—through the use of ambiguity and the subversion of feminine stereotypes to convey Ebain's character.</p>
<p>Ebain's autocratic tendencies are further highlighted by the narrator's description of the English king as judge. "His rules were not just idle talk—there wasn't a man in the kingdom . . . whom he wouldn't have thrown in jail if he dared to break his laws on such terms that, right or wrong, he wouldn't get out till he was dead. He upheld justice in his realm."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29" class="rid-fn-text">29</a></sup> In the midst of praising Ebain's firm provision of justice, the narrator hints at the undue and unjust severity of the king's punishments, which we come to see as based in the underlying intemperate and dictatorial character of the king.</p>
<p>This undue severity is then linked to Ebain's lack of self-restraint in a case of disputed inheritance, "Then a count with twin daughters came to the land. Two counts married the girls. Each one claimed to have the older, but one of the two must have had the younger. There was a quarrel over the inheritance, for both of them wanted to have the land. One wanted to share it equally; the other said he would be a martyr and vile coward in battle before he would yield an inch of it."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30" class="rid-fn-text">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Warfare threatens to break out between the two brothers-in-law, so the king calls them to Chester to negotiate a settlement. Neither would compromise, and both died while fighting a duel. Furious, Ebain outlaws female inheritance.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31" class="rid-fn-text">31</a></sup> The unchecked anger of both the counts and the king leads to injustice and dishonor. The counts' lack of self-restraint prompts them to refuse the counsel of the king and nobles to establish an honorable settlement to their dispute. Ebain's rage deprives his nobles of their proper<strong> [End Page 142] </strong> role in society by infringing upon the transmission of their inherited property and excluding them from their advisory role in creating and enforcing law; his rage is thus a fundamental attack on their honor.</p>
<p>The question at the heart of this quarrel is whether only the eldest daughter has a claim on her father's property or whether all daughters share equally. A short excursus on inheritance law and customs will help to contextualize Heldris's plot device for modern readers (the thirteenth-century noble audience would have been quite conversant with the issues). In England and in France, the privilege of masculinity prevailed—eldest sons inherited the bulk of the family property, while younger sons and daughters were provided for with acquired property. In the absence of male heirs, female heirs inherited both allodial property and fiefs. Around the 1140s in England, the law became: "where there is no son, the daughters divide their father's land by spindles, and the elder cannot take from the younger her half of the land without violence and injury."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32" class="rid-fn-text">32</a></sup> However, partible inheritance for female heirs also required a determination of who would hold the <em>caput</em> or chief messuage, or in legal terminology, the <em>aînesse</em>. As the historian J.C. Holt has argued, this did not necessarily go to the eldest daughter—it could also go to the resident unmarried daughter or the daughter who had the most powerful husband.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33" class="rid-fn-text">33</a></sup> In 1209 Philip Augustus, in consultation with a noble assembly, decided that in case of parage for fiefs that pertained directly to the king, each inheritor must do homage to the lord rather than the eldest doing homage to the lord and his/her siblings doing homage to the eldest.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34" class="rid-fn-text">34</a></sup></p>
<p>It would thus seem that the count who sought an equal division of the sisters' inheritance had the right of it in English and French law. The argument over who had married the eldest is not, as Kinoshita implies, irrelevant, since <em>aînesse</em> determined ownership of the <em>caput</em> in England.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35" class="rid-fn-text">35</a></sup> The poet tells us that the case or lawsuit (<em>li plais</em>) was so contentious that a judicial duel was set, and Ebain and his nobles were unable to mediate and enforce a peaceful settlement based upon the law.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36" class="rid-fn-text">36</a></sup> Kinoshita argues that Ebain was "powerless" to resolve this case.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37" class="rid-fn-text">37</a></sup> Ebain had the power and the legal means to settle the dispute. What turned this lawsuit into an armed conflict was uncontrolled anger. It was the anger of the claimants that led to their deaths and the threat of continued violence among their noble peers that roused the king's ire. As the historians Richard Barton and Stephen White have argued, anger had a well-recognized formal role in the settlement of disputes in medieval society.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38" class="rid-fn-text">38</a></sup> One showed anger to indicate that one's honors or rights had been harmed, and this signal initiated a process of negotiation in which both parties sought to right the relationship.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39" class="rid-fn-text">39</a></sup> Violence used to bring the parties to the negotiating table was considered<strong> [End Page 143] </strong> just, but the goal was a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In the counts' case, anger worked well in the beginning, but the intransigence of the two parties led to the social ills that medieval preachers taught stemmed from anger: insults, fights, vengeance, and other violence.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40" class="rid-fn-text">40</a></sup> This type of anger (<em>ira per vitium</em>, stemming from vice) should be opposed by <em>ira regis</em> (a form of <em>ira per zelum</em> or anger against vice). A good king uses his anger to maintain peace and justice within his realm.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41" class="rid-fn-text">41</a></sup> Thus, Ebain initially responded appropriately to the counts' anger; however, he lost control of his emotions when confronted with the threat of warfare among all his vassals. Enraged by the loss of his men and his control over the situation, Ebain abolished female inheritance in his kingdom. The king's decision was unjust, for it punished those who had not violated the peace. While the narrator does not blame Ebain's intemperance for his hasty and unfair decree, the author tacitly asks us to see where Ebain's rage leads through the juxtaposition of his lack of anger before the duel and his fury afterwards. Similarly, Cador acts angrily and unjustly when he banishes, without consulting his men, all troubadours from his county in response to Silence's disappearance.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42" class="rid-fn-text">42</a></sup> Throughout the story, uncontrolled anger on the part of those in positions of power leads to injustice.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43" class="rid-fn-text">43</a></sup></p>
<p>The poet's choice of the name Silentius or Silence (an name uncommon in romance or history) in part reflects the desire for a unisex name which can be switched from male to female should the necessity arise. It also may be intended to emphasize the injustice of Ebain's law and to highlight a lord's need for wise words of advice. Cador, states "We shall call her silence, after Saint Patience, because silence relieves care."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44" class="rid-fn-text">44</a></sup> The reference to patience also resonates with the idea of biding one's time until the need for disguise is over. Caroline Jewers has argued the meaning of "relieves care/anxiety" may stem from the legal principle that Cador cannot be held guilty of perjury or fraud because he has not directly lied.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45" class="rid-fn-text">45</a></sup> In Justinian's <em>Digest</em>, directly preceding the discussion of the legal meaning of silence, is a passage which states "Anything which is established against a rule of law should not become a precedent." While it is possible that a few members of the noble audience of this tale would have caught these legal allusions, the religious connotations of Silence's name would be more evident to them. Throughout the Middle Ages in the juxtaposition of vices and virtues, <em>ira</em> (anger) is generally opposed by <em>patientia</em> (patience); Ebain's anger and subsequent unjust behavior thus will be exposed by Silence's patience.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46" class="rid-fn-text">46</a></sup> The poet reverses the traditional gendering of emotion and reason—it is Ebain who is emotional and lacking in restraint and Silence who is calm and self-controlled. Ebain's intemperate statute sets in motion further injustices. Queen Eufeme's false accusations and plots against Silence's life are a direct<strong> [End Page 144] </strong> consequence of Ebain's law, and Silence faces these tribulations patiently.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47" class="rid-fn-text">47</a></sup> The king allows rage to overcome justice when he acquiesces to the queen's scheme to send Silence in search of Merlin. Silence is banished rather than rewarded for winning the battle against the rebels. Silence, nonetheless, continues to serve loyally.</p>
<p>Ebain's fiat to abolish female inheritance was not only an unjust punishment for the nobles' violence; it violated his vassals' property rights and abrogated the proper means of creating law. As Kinoshita persuasively argues, Ebain's law changes the relationship between lord and vassals: "Evan [Ebain] in effect affirms that patrimonies are transmitted not through the laws of inheritance but by royal decree."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48" class="rid-fn-text">48</a></sup> Military service would no longer be sufficient to ensure a noble's status and role within the kingdom; a male heir must be produced. Like Ebain's vassals, real nobles in thirteenth-century northern France faced a similar specter with Philip Augustus's increasingly routine intervention in cases of female inheritance.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49" class="rid-fn-text">49</a></sup> Abuse of lordship, particularly failure to seek the advice of one's nobles, is explicitly and implicitly criticized throughout the poem. The immediate reaction of the fictional nobles to the new law is mixed: "Some [swore] in anger, but most did it quite gladly—the ones who had nothing to lose. But as for those who had only daughters and huge holdings to bequeath, don't you think their hearts were filled with rancor?"<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50" class="rid-fn-text">50</a></sup> The author thus alludes to the lack of emotional control on the part of the nobles who then do not fulfill their obligation of giving good advice to their lord. The Count of Chester articulates some of the nobles' disgruntlement over the new law while advising Cador to marry Eufemie: "for all of Cornwall will be yours at the death of count Renald. Now it would be a good idea to explain: the land should have been this lady's, but she no longer has a right to it."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51" class="rid-fn-text">51</a></sup> After repeating why the king has prohibited female inheritance, he sarcastically continues, "Now the king wants to bestow the land on this lady and you. Isn't he doing you a tremendous favor?"<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52" class="rid-fn-text">52</a></sup></p>
<p>The infringement on noble property was matched by the circumvention of the proper means of creating law. The historian Gavin Langmuir has shown that in later twelfth- and thirteenth-century France, legal change was predicated upon a lord (noble or royal) obtaining the counsel and common assent of the nobles.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53" class="rid-fn-text">53</a></sup> For example, new laws instituting primogeniture in Brittany in 1185, the regulation of female inheritance and the inheritance of fiefs in Champagne in 1212 and 1224, and royal regulation of inheritance in Maine and Anjou in 1246, all stress the nobles' role in formulating and assenting to the statutes.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54" class="rid-fn-text">54</a></sup> Ebain acted unilaterally when he created the new law, and then had the nobles swear to uphold the decree.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55" class="rid-fn-text">55</a></sup> While Ebain co-opted the assent of the nobles, he did not gain their counsel. At no point<strong> [End Page 145] </strong> in the poem does the poet show Ebain's nobles discussing or debating in the councils that Ebain calls. This pro forma calling of councils deprives the English king of his nobles' wisdom and further illustrates his lack of restraint. The dangers of the lack of counsel are also illustrated by Cador's intemperate law banishing minstrels under pain of death; his decision is made without counsel, and only the good eyesight and wise speech of an old man saves Silence (in her guise as minstrel) from death.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56" class="rid-fn-text">56</a></sup></p>
<p>By his intemperate and unjust action, Ebain creates an environment at court that discourages his nobles from offering wise counsel, and he creates resentment and disloyalty. Cador, the king's nephew and most accomplished knight, deceives his lord and violates the law in order to preserve his heir's property. Throughout the poem, when Cador and Silence speak about the reasons for their deception, they emphasize the preservation of her <em>iretage</em>, the legal term for inherited, allodial property.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57" class="rid-fn-text">57</a></sup> Silence, troubled by Nature's argument, tells Nurture that "this behavior is unnatural. Truly, no woman of my lineage ever behaved in such a way."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58" class="rid-fn-text">58</a></sup> Her view is supported by Nature, who argues that Silence "should not cultivate such savage ways for fief or inheritance."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59" class="rid-fn-text">59</a></sup> Silence rejects Nature's argument and sides with Reason and Nurture, driven by the privileges of "maleness" and her duty to her lineage. Although he seemingly acquiesces to the king's marriage of his daughter (and dispossessed heir), Count Renaud "took Cador to the king and invested him then and there with whatever he held in fief, provided his daughter should have an heir. If she died without an heir, it should go to the rightful claimant."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60" class="rid-fn-text">60</a></sup> Renaud thereby affirms that inherited property is governed by different customs (or laws) than fiefs. The distinction between fiefs and inherited property (fief and <em>iretage</em>), highlighted by the poet's choice of terms throughout the poem as well as in thirteenth-century customals, reveals the poet's and the nobility's rejection of the amalgamation of fiefs and allodial property effected by Ebain's decree. The <em>iretage</em> is linked with lineage and honor (the family's accumulated lands and dignity), and the preservation of status, and thus, on Ebain's unjust attack on nobles' power and prestige.</p>
<p>The author creates a telling contrast between Ebain's failure to seek true counsel and the behavior of the French King. When in a quandary over what is the honorable course of action, the French King calls upon his counselors to discuss the issue; the poet devotes over 340 lines to the discussion.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61" class="rid-fn-text">61</a></sup> After greeting Silence with a kiss of peace, thereby entering her into his peace and safe conduct, the French King is faced by the unjust behavior of a vassal—Ebain asks him in a letter to kill his vassal for an unstated crime.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62" class="rid-fn-text">62</a></sup> In response to this dilemma that concerns both royal justice and honor, the king seeks the advice of three trusted counts. These counts<strong> [End Page 146] </strong> discuss their views in private, and when one voices the fear that the king will not like their advice, the "wisest" of them answers, "Is this any reason to keep silent and deny him proper counsel, if he requests it? By God, no! If he asks for it, I am duty bound to give him sound advice, and then let him act as befits a king!"<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63" class="rid-fn-text">63</a></sup> The French King follows their advice, thereby preventing Silence from being unjustly killed by Queen Eufeme's false accusation and letter. As a good lord, the king has preserved justice and his own honor, as well as gained a knight of great skill. The French King's vassals flourish and peace reigns in his kingdom because he honors them by seeking and following their advice, behaving with justice and self-restraint, and rewarding their good service.</p>
<p>Just as the French King personifies good lordship, Silence's actions exemplify the ideals of noble behavior. She is, as Suzanne Kocher has discussed, a <em>mireöir</em>, a didactic model with her exemplary character and upbringing.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64" class="rid-fn-text">64</a></sup> Her ability to achieve these ideals has its origins in her ancestry, or as it would have been phrased in the thirteenth century, Silence is <em>debonaire</em>. To be <em>debonaire</em> literally meant that one comes from a good lineage and region. The adjective also connotes good sense, wise speech, clemency and pity (<em>débonnaireté</em>).<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65" class="rid-fn-text">65</a></sup> It was also used to mean meekness or patient self-restraint, as can be seen in the commonplace of thirteenth-century French sermons: "Blessed are the debonaire for they shall inherit the earth."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66" class="rid-fn-text">66</a></sup> While the poet does not specifically use the adjective "<em>debonaire</em>," Nature's two hundred line description of her creation of Silence as a masterpiece (<em>ouvre forcible</em>) through a process like sifting white flour (a code for nobility) emphasizes the child's noble nature.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67" class="rid-fn-text">67</a></sup> Throughout the romance the author also refers to Silence as coming from good stock and emphasizes her nature and education, which reveal her goodness, intelligence, and honor.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68" class="rid-fn-text">68</a></sup> Silence's character is indirectly compared to Eufemie whom the poet characterizes as "de pute aire" ("of bad character").<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69" class="rid-fn-text">69</a></sup> <em>Débonnaireté</em> is a quality both men and women can exhibit. Silence's family is distinguished; her father, Cador, is of royal descent and a brave and skillful warrior; her mother Eufemie was "well versed in the seven arts," the wisest doctor in the kingdom, and heir of a distinguished lineage. Throughout the poem Silence expresses an awareness of her distinguished ancestry and ancestral land: in the many references to Cornwall as her heritage (<em>iretage</em>), in her reflections upon her own "male" behavior in comparison to the other women of her lineage, and in her knowledge of Gorlois of Cornwall as her ancestor.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70" class="rid-fn-text">70</a></sup> Silence shares her parents' traits, and this nature, in combination with the careful upbringing provided by her parents, allows her to excel as a knight.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71" class="rid-fn-text">71</a></sup> As both a jongleur in training and as a knight, Silence loyally serves her lords. She brings distinction to the French King's court by her tournament<strong> [End Page 147] </strong> victories; her nurture at the French court, where the king provides good lordship—liberality, justice, and peace—allows her fame to grow. She also serves Ebain loyally, saving his life and winning the battle for him against the rebels. As the Count of Clermont states, loyalty, even when a lord asks something unworthy or even shameful, is owed to a lord.<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72" class="rid-fn-text">72</a></sup> After watching the furious queen falsely accuse her of rape, Silence "muttered softly, 'She is gravely in the wrong, but whatever she does, she is my lady. I must not sully her reputation.'"<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73" class="rid-fn-text">73</a></sup> In addition to her loyalty, Silence exercises self-restraint. During the battle against the Count of Chester, Silence encourages her men to fight with honor and act with restraint.<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74" class="rid-fn-text">74</a></sup> She does not display anger when Ebain fails to reward her service against the rebels; she patiently suffers the dishonor and obeys the king's command to bring Merlin to his court.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75" class="rid-fn-text">75</a></sup> Even though Merlin behaved treacherously to her ancestor Gorlois, Silence restrains her just anger in order to faithfully serve Ebain.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76" class="rid-fn-text">76</a></sup> Silence's actions throughout reveal her character (both innate and nourished) and exemplify the traits needed to be a good vassal.</p>
<p>The Count of Chester's rebellion, which threatens to strip the English king of his kingdom, highlights the failure of Ebain's lordship; Silence's <em>débonnaireté</em>, however, defeats the evil consequences of Ebain's intemperance and injustice. Silence's prowess (a 'masculine' trait) saves Ebain (here cast as the female to be rescued). Despite Silence's faithful service, Ebain falls prey to anger and his wife's deceit, and he banishes Silence on an "impossible" quest to bring Merlin to court (since only a woman can catch Merlin). Heldris specifically states that Merlin's visit will reveal "the king's wrongdoing."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77" class="rid-fn-text">77</a></sup> Merlin's revelations expose Ebain as both a bad lord and a bad husband. The queen's and Silence's deceptions dishonor the king, but this dishonor had its origins in his own wrathful prohibition of female inheritance and in his silencing of their wisdom and advice. Ebain's shame prompts him to restore right relations in his kingdom. His first act is to abolish the bad law against female inheritance, thereby rewarding Silence's loyal vassalage. The nobles are overjoyed and Silence tells Ebain: "It is by his acts that one know who is truly king."<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78" class="rid-fn-text">78</a></sup> Ebain then executes Eufeme by proper procedure and universal assent; then, with the advice of his nobles, he marries Silence.<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79" class="rid-fn-text">79</a></sup></p>
<p>Silence's marriage introduces her to the societally-defined role of wife and mother and thus, back into the system for transmitting property. As McCracken and others have argued, "Silence's assumption of a female identity is profoundly troubled at the end of the romance."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80" class="rid-fn-text">80</a></sup> For McCracken and Kinoshita, Silence's marriage ratifies female silence and exclusion from power; however, the author's ambiguity maintains his challenge to the assumption of a biological rather than a socially constructed definition of gender. Silence may be restored to a traditional gendered role, but the poet's<strong> [End Page 148] </strong> abrupt and ambiguous conclusion broaches the proposition that marriage, like lordship, requires one to behave honorably and to draw upon the wisdom and skills of one's subordinate partner(s).</p>
<p>The foregrounding of marriage in tandem with a display of good lordship at the conclusion of the poem suggests the poet's ideas about the nature of good lordship also apply to marriage. This connection is reinforced by the centrality of marriage to the narrative—the marriages of Ebain and Eufeme, Cador and Eufemie, the counts and the twin heiresses, and finally, of Ebain and Silence. The link between lordship and marriage is also not uncommon in twelfth and thirteenth-century romances. Marriage, in the guise of adulterous queens, is used to critique a king's ability to rule (in this case, lordship).<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81" class="rid-fn-text">81</a></sup> A king's inability to retain the love of an ideal woman, for example Mark and Isolde, suggests that if he cannot rule his household, then he cannot rule his kingdom effectively either. The pleasure-seeking adulterous wife, similarly, such as the queen in <em>Le Roman de sept sages</em>, threatens the integrity of the realm, and serves as a symbol of inadequate lordship. As the medievalist Katie Keene has argued, Eufeme combines, most unusually, these two types of unfaithful queen.<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82" class="rid-fn-text">82</a></sup> For the medieval audience then, Ebain is shown to be a bad lord, who is unable to rule either household or realm effectively; his faults as a husband, similarly, derive from his belief that women should be silent.</p>
<p>My claim that good marriages depend on women's speech and men's solicitation of their wives' counsel and assent may appear counter-intuitive, given the symbolism of the names Heldris gives to the female characters, particularly the hero(ine). The author's choices, however, both encapsulate his society's practices and expectations—that women should be silent in public but never are—and also allow him to challenge the prevailing wisdom.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83" class="rid-fn-text">83</a></sup> Eufeme and Eufemie represent two familiar caricatures of women. Eufeme, whose name can be read as "Alas, woman," enacts all the negative stereotypes; she is lustful, scheming, disloyal, vengeful, and deceitful. Eufemie, whose name suggests good speech, by contrast, is the typical romance heroine: courteous, wise, beautiful, honorable, and subordinate.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84" class="rid-fn-text">84</a></sup> Silence transcends both literary and real life conventions. As Psaki asks, what other romance "take[s] it for granted that absolute chivalric and poetic preeminence are within reach of a woman—without ever even discussing the issue? The narrator offers no explanation or apology for the fact that this most perfect of women can be a perfect knight, even saving her king's throne when some of his vassals rebel. It is apparently assumed that, freed of the various constraints of a 'female' upbringing, women can disprove even the most commonplace accusations of the antifeminist diatribe. Hence, clearly, one of the resonances of the heroine's name—she is innocent of<strong> [End Page 149] </strong> stereotypical female garrulousness."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85" class="rid-fn-text">85</a></sup></p>
<p>The poet suggests that it is men who inscribe gender upon women: Cador, with his wife's consent, engenders his daughter physically and socially, just as later it is Ebain's declaration of Silence's femaleness that regenders her female (although nature then has to spend three days removing all traces of masculinity from Silence's body).<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86" class="rid-fn-text">86</a></sup> Cador's decision is predicated upon Ebain's silencing of his nobles' advice and denying them their proper role in law-making. The author likewise suggests that female duplicity is generally the product of society's silencing of women's voices. It is by this nurture that "woman has less motivation, provided that she even has the choice, to be good than to be bad."<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87" class="rid-fn-text">87</a></sup></p>
<p>Nurture is the key to understanding not only the characters of Eufeme and Eufemie, but also the qualities that will lead to a good marriage. Both women are initially described as beautiful and of distinguished birth, so by nature—the implication is—the two are equal.<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88" class="rid-fn-text">88</a></sup> What distinguishes the two must therefore be their nurture. Eufemie is learned in the seven liberal arts and particularly distinguished by her medical knowledge. Her intelligence is both nurtured as well as native ("neither my learning nor my native intelligence").<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89" class="rid-fn-text">89</a></sup> Eufemie uses the power of speech and her intelligence to good effect when she and Cador suffer the typical romantic fear of unrequited love. Their romantic impasse is broken through speech, first hers and then Cador's.<sup><a name="f90-text" href="#f90" class="rid-fn-text">90</a></sup> Once each is assured of the other's love, they confer on the best plan to get the king to agree to their marriage; "He saw them talking and taking counsel privately and whispering and speaking."<sup><a name="f91-text" href="#f91" class="rid-fn-text">91</a></sup> At each challenge they face (with the exception of the law against minstrels), Cador and Eufemie are shown communicating and acting in concert, thereby drawing upon each other's wisdom. During Eufemie's pregnancy, Cador comes to her with a plan to preserve their lands if their child is a daughter. Cador begins by stating that the sacrament of marriage has made them one flesh and that their will should be one as well. He then presents his plan to raise a daughter as a boy in order to preserve their property. At each stage, Eufemie agrees with his reasoning and consents to the plan.<sup><a name="f92-text" href="#f92" class="rid-fn-text">92</a></sup> Cador is clearly the decision maker, or lord, but as a good husband and lord, he always seeks Eufemie's advice and consent. Her wisdom is now his, just as both are of one mind and body by marriage. Eufemie is subsumed into Cador's persona ("the countess, his wife"), and yet <em>Cador never assumes her consent</em>. He truthfully presents his ideas and plans and seeks her agreement and counsel. By doing so, he preserves the honor of both, and the result is a productive and happy marriage as well as a peaceful county.</p>
<p>In contrast, while Eufeme's noble birth (she is a Norwegian princess) and beauty are established at her entrance into the story, throughout the<strong> [End Page 150] </strong> tale she is never consulted. This lack of consultation is first shown at her betrothal; it was her father's and Ebain's decision for her to marry.<sup><a name="f93-text" href="#f93" class="rid-fn-text">93</a></sup> The consequence of this lack of consultation is subtly alluded to by the description of her arrival in England. She is courteously and affectionately greeted by Ebain, but her own "heart was a little bitter from the tiring journey across the sea," perhaps because she is a war trophy not Ebain's beloved in the <em>fin d'amor</em> tradition, despite Ebain's claim to have "long suffered for love" of a woman he has never met.<sup><a name="f94-text" href="#f94" class="rid-fn-text">94</a></sup> Shaped by a nurture that has denied her a voice, Eufeme becomes "highly skilled" in deception and prey to all the flaws attributed to women in medieval commonplace: she is lascivious, changeable, irrational, duplicitous, conniving, and disloyal.<sup><a name="f95-text" href="#f95" class="rid-fn-text">95</a></sup> As Nature asserts, "And many a heart of noble nature becomes much worse through nurture and hardens itself to very shameful ways."<sup><a name="f96-text" href="#f96" class="rid-fn-text">96</a></sup> Ebain only seeks Eufeme's assent when he has already succumbed to unjust rage. He lies to her about the punishment he intends for Silence, after Eufeme's first accusation of rape, as "he wasn't crazy or foolish enough to destroy the lad because of her terrible rage."<sup><a name="f97-text" href="#f97" class="rid-fn-text">97</a></sup> Ebain judges her anger to be too extreme to be just, and therefore as "a wise and moderate fellow," he would save everyone's reputation by sending Silence from the court.<sup><a name="f98-text" href="#f98" class="rid-fn-text">98</a></sup> The narrator's assessment here is shown to be false; Ebain's moderation is in fact gravely disloyal to his wife and her honor; he arbitrarily judges the case without gathering any evidence. He presents his decision to Eufeme as a fait accompli, and she, suspicious, unwillingly accedes to his plan. Ebain then goes on to justify his lie to her as a way to save himself from her nagging him to do her will. His lies and failure to gain her true assent lead the queen to usurp his position of judge and lawgiver. It was a commonplace of the era that "the king was law; the queen was mercy."<sup><a name="f99-text" href="#f99" class="rid-fn-text">99</a></sup> The substitution of her letter (requesting the French King to kill Silence) for her husband's makes her the judge and feminizes her husband—he acts mercifully while she demands the letter of the law. Although Eufeme's duplicity in the matter of the false letter is revealed to Ebain, he is still deceived by the queen's next accusation against Silence because he allows his rage to overpower his reason. He therefore agrees to her plan to banish Silence by a quest to capture Merlin. Both Ebain and Eufeme are dishonored by the voicelessness that is foisted upon her. She is exposed as an adulterous schemer and Ebain as a cuckold and dishonorable lord.</p>
<p>Ebain never seems to realize the role he has played in nurturing Eufeme's character, as he continues to champion the ideal of a woman's silence, "A woman's role is to keep silent. So help me God, I think a mute can tell what women are good for, for they're only good for one thing, and that is to keep silent."<sup><a name="f100-text" href="#f100" class="rid-fn-text">100</a></sup> Just as Ebain fails to appreciate the need to gain true consent from his vassals, he seems oblivious to the need to gain a wife's assent<strong> [End Page 151] </strong> through consultation. Silence's reaction to Ebain's actions in the final scene is telling. While the king has declared her female—Silentia—her actions are still those of a knight. She praises him for restoring female inheritance, telling him, "It is by his acts that one knows who is truly king."<sup><a name="f101-text" href="#f101" class="rid-fn-text">101</a></sup> She assumes the garb of femininity and says nothing about the proposed marriage. She withholds her judgment and her speech; by his actions she will know what kind of husband she will have.<sup><a name="f102-text" href="#f102" class="rid-fn-text">102</a></sup> Will Ebain act upon her proven wisdom and good character by seeking her advice and assent in private? Or will he be fooled by Nature's removal of all masculine traces upon her body and treat her as he treated Eufeme?</p>
<p>While Heldris leaves this question unanswered, a couple of clues suggest that Ebain will probably not change. Ebain, most tellingly, does not follow the legal procedures for a valid marriage—he does not seek the consent of Silence, her parents, or the Church, since he and Silence are related within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity—and this is in marked contrast to his careful following of procedure in the marriage of Cador and Eufemie.<sup><a name="f103-text" href="#f103" class="rid-fn-text">103</a></sup> The narrator's injunction that "A good woman should neither take offense nor blame herself for someone else's faults, but simply strive all the harder to do what is right" more subtly seems to indicate that Silence will have to patiently suffer Ebain's "faults" as husband and lord. Silence's <em>débonnaireté</em> suggests that she will act virtuously, giving Ebain unsolicited advice as is her duty, for as the narrator states "[she does not] care to remain silent any longer."<sup><a name="f104-text" href="#f104" class="rid-fn-text">104</a></sup> "As the antithesis of her outspoken and treacherous predecessor Queen Eufeme, Silence is exalted as a model of circumspection and loyalty."<sup><a name="f105-text" href="#f105" class="rid-fn-text">105</a></sup> Circumspection is not necessarily silence; Eufemie, a model of traditional feminine virtue, was not silent.</p>
<p>If one's true nature is known by one's actions, then the poet suggests that silence is disastrous—it leads to dishonor and discord in marriage as well as in feudal governance. The seeking and giving of advice allows all parties to share their wisdom and prevent injustice. While lords and husbands are by custom the superior in their relationships, it is incumbent upon them not to act unilaterally. <em>Débonnaireté</em>—wise speech, good sense, and patient self-restraint—is a virtue both men and women can have and are the hallmarks of good lords, vassals, husbands, and wives. It is the duty of vassals and wives to offer the best possible advice they can, even if it rouses the anger of the lord or husband. It is a lord's and husband's duty to actively confer with their subordinates and not allow anger to overcome their judgment. Only then can true consent be given and peace maintained. The juxtaposition of two irreconcilable gender ideologies without resolution at the end of the poem leaves the reader or listener, today as well as in the medieval period, without a definitive answer. I would argue, however, that<strong> [End Page 152] </strong> throughout the romance, the proponents of feminine silence and exclusion from lordship and inheritance are shown to be lacking in wisdom; Heldris is thus implicitly advocating women's ability to participate in governance, either as lords or as vassals. To silence Silence (Silentia/Silentius), or indeed any subordinate (male or female), leads to turmoil, injustice, and a disunified realm.</p>
