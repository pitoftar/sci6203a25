<p>The following argument applies the insights of relational psychoanalytical gender theory to the construction of transsexuality.

</a></span> reveals the continuing influence of the patriarchal assumptions that shaped Freud's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0011" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) construction of gender in contemporary psychoanalysis (Goldner, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0012" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2002</a></span>, pp. 63–72). These assumptions are especially apparent in the more conservative psychoanalytic discourses concerning transsexuality. These particular discourses, moreover, echo the same desire to enforce heteronormativity that shapes the manner in which modern medicine constructs the figure of the transsexual.
</p>
<p>Transsexuality, or a variant of it, predates the modern period. According to current diagnostic criteria, figures such as the Assyrian king Sardanapalus, who was reported to have dressed as a woman and to have spun with his wives, and the 18th-century Chevalier d'Eon, who was a rival of Madame Pompadour for the attentions of Louis XV, could be considered transsexuals (Stone, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. 282). Modern transsexuality, however, is marked by the competing discourses of the doctor and the psychoanalyst. Since mid-20th-century scientific advances made it possible, transsexuals have insisted that their bodies need to be altered in order to correctly reflect their true selves. The complicity of doctors in fulfilling this insistence stems from the view held by the scientific establishment that anatomy is inseparable from gender. Classical psychoanalytical theory also accords a fundamental role to the body in the formation of gender identity. As Nancy Partner (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0025" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>) elegantly summarizes,
<div class="quote">
<p class="first last">In most people (excluding the richly informative but relatively rare cases of those with identity disorders) anatomical sex is the basis for a corresponding core gender identity, which is the central psychic structure for the elaborated, psychologically motivated gender of later life, incorporating sexuality and cultural patterning [p. 441].</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>Yet modern medicine and psychoanalysis approach transsexuality from opposing ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Whereas medicine responds to transsexuals' claims of being wrongly embodied by attempting to recreate their bodies, psychoanalysts attempt to reconcile transsexuals to the reality of their flesh. Despite their differing responses to transsexuality, however, the goals of medicine and psychoanalysis coincide. Both disciplines attempt to resolve the disjunction between body and mind that characterizes this condition because neither accepts the idea that gender can be divorced from the body. Both disciplines, moreover, also continue to construct transsexuality from a largely patriarchal perspective.</p>
<p>In particular, the higher degree of interest in male-to-female rather than female-to-male transsexuals in both medicine and psychoanalysis implicitly problematizes the negation of masculinity while at the same time normalizing the rejection of femininity. In effect, because of the manner in which it constructs family relations, classical psychoanalysis is better able to theorize the problem of male-to-female transsexuality than female-to-male transsexuality. The medical establishment is similarly more concerned with male-to-female transsexuals than female-to-male transsexuals. This is attributable both to the fact that the surgical procedures that male-to-female transsexuals undergo are more radical and that like psychoanalysis, medicine privileges the masculine over the feminine.</p>
<p>The author of the 13th-century romance <i>Le Roman de Silence</i>, Heldris de Cornuälle, also conceives of gender as being inextricably linked to the body and he, too, places male identity in a privileged position. Because his understanding of gender so closely resembles the way in which medicine and psychoanalysis construct the figure of the transsexual, bringing this medieval text into conversation with modern transsexuality can illuminate the complexities that characterize both Heldris's position and contemporary understandings of the importance of the body in the construction of the self. Moreover, because <i>Le Roman de Silence</i> predates the existence of transsexuality as a diagnostic category, this romance can also offer us important insights into the transsexual experience. It can elucidate the aspects of transsexuality that remain when the surgeon and the clinician are removed.</p>
<p>In <i>Le Roman de Silence</i>, a nobleman raises his daughter as a boy in order to circumvent the king's prohibition of female inheritance.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>

</a></span> The child, named Silence, runs away to become a minstrel but later returns home to England and becomes a knight in the king's court. After the queen unsuccessfully tries to seduce him, she accuses him of attempted rape and he is sent to France, where he gains renown with the French royal household. He later returns to the English court, where the queen again fails to seduce him and again falsely denounces him to the king. As punishment, the queen demands that Silence be sent to capture the magician Merlin. He does so and returns to court with Merlin, who then reveals both the queen's treachery and Silence's true sex. The queen is killed and the king marries Silence in her stead.
</p>
<p>Even though I am proposing to examine this text through the lens of late 20th-century transsexuality, I would like to emphasize that Heldris does not conceive of his heroine as a female-to-male transsexual. His main concern is the question of women's potential to be the equals of men. He uses the figure of Silence, who is biologically female but who lives as a male, in order to explore this issue. Rather than being a deliberate move on Heldris's part, the resemblance between Silence's situation and that of a modern transsexual is purely coincidental. As we see, however, despite the differing cultural expectations that shape the understanding of gender, there is a large degree of overlap between Heldris's treatment of Silence's experience of living as a man and modern psychoanalytical and medical discourses of transsexuality.</p>
<p>The contemporary medical definition of <i>transsexuality</i> was profoundly influenced by Harry Benjamin's pioneering work in this field and in <i>The Transsexual Phenomenon</i>, which was published in <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>, he resists the idea that transsexuality might result solely from psychological factors such as imprinting and childhood conditioning. Instead, he theorizes that these factors might work in conjunction with a biological circumstance, such as the influence of the mother's hormones on the development of the fetus or an as yet undetermined genetic or chromosomal cause (pp. 73–85). In a formulation that echoes Partner's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0025" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>) summary of the psychoanalytical account of gender, Benjamin argues, “Our genetic and endocrine equipment constitutes either an unresponsive, sterile, or a more or less responsive, that is to say, fertile soil on which the wrong conditioning and a psychic trauma can grow and develop into such a basic conflict that subsequently a deviation like transsexualism can result” (p. 85). This echo is not coincidental. His ostensible refusal to pass judgment on psychoanalysis as a discipline notwithstanding, Benjamin implicitly criticizes psychoanalysts who fail to consider the influence of biology on the development of sexual identity as misunderstanding Freud: “Freud himself, if alive today, would not deny a possible constitutional basis, as he believed in ‘hereditary, organically fixated, and not only educational factors'” (p. 40).</p>
<p>Despite Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) attempt to situate himself as a continuator of Freud, however, the relationship between the doctor and the transsexual is, from the perspective of psychoanalysis, rather suspect. In her 1983 book <i>Horsexe</i>, Catherine Millot, a practicing Lacanian psychoanalyst, questions the modern interaction between doctors and transsexuals. She argues that late-20th-century transsexuality differs from the transsexuality of earlier periods because of the interaction between the person seeking to alter his or her biological sex and the doctor who can fulfill this request (p. 17). She maintains that the present-day transsexual combines his inner conviction with a demand addressed to the Other—a role fulfilled by the doctor (p. 17). “That this Other proposes an answer to the question of desire leads the transsexual to become the object of his desire: he is the guinea-pig sacrificed body and soul to Science, and pays with his body in order to strengthen the phantasy of the omnipotence of modern Science” (p. 142). Millot thus puts the contemporary transsexual into the role of a hysteric, striving to fulfill the desire of an all-powerful analyst.</p>
<p>Benjamin's (1966) characterization of the doctor's responsibility toward the transsexual rather ironically substantiates Millot's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>) critique. The scientific conceit on which Millot focuses becomes especially apparent in his differentiation between transsexuals, transvestites,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0003" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>

<sup>4</sup>
</a></span> (p. 19). (The subject of intersex becomes especially relevant later in this discussion, but at this point I wish to dwell on the difference that Benjamin theorizes between transvestites and transsexuals.) Even though he views transvestism as a milder form of the disturbance in sex and gender orientation that characterizes transsexuality (p. 19), he draws a dividing line between the two conditions: transvestites acknowledge their masculinity<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>5</sup>
</a></span> whereas transsexuals, who can be either male or female, are deeply unhappy with their bodies, especially their genitals, because they feel that they belong to the opposite sex (p. 13).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0006" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>6</sup>
</a></span> He argues that although transsexuals can derive some comfort from cross-dressing, unlike transvestites, they can never be fully satisfied by such measures. Their suffering can be relieved only by the removal of their sex organs (p. 13). Whereas transvestites “usually want to be left alone,” the transsexual “puts all his faith and future into the hands of the doctor” (p. 14).



</p>
<p>Benjamin (1966) thus entrusts the doctor with the salvation of the hapless transsexual. He argues that before advances in endocrinology and surgical techniques made sex-change operations possible, transsexuals could only suffer passively: <b>“</b>Some of them probably languished in mental institutions, some in prisons, and the majority as miserable, unhappy members of the community, unless they committed suicide” (p. 14). Pat Califia (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>), a sex therapist and an alternative sexuality advocate, recognizes the compassion underlying Benjamin's wish to help transsexuals, but at the same time she, like Millot (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>), is skeptical of his characterization of the doctor's intervention as an alleviation of the transsexual's suffering. She argues that Benjamin's rhetoric is a form of justification aimed at mitigating the enormity of surgically reconstructing a body that is to all intents and purposes fully functional: “This makes it sound as if the surgeon is morally compelled, almost blackmailed, into operating, lest he contribute to self-destruction” (p. 59).</p>
<p>Millot (1983), Benjamin (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>), and Califia (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) each interpret the doctor's role in modern transsexuality from different perspectives, but all three recognize the magnitude of the power of medicine to transform anatomical sex, even if this transformation is limited to the surface of the body. Millot and Califia are openly uncomfortable about the seeming readiness of doctors to provide sex-change surgeries whereas Benjamin's insistence on the potential of medicine to significantly improve the transsexual's life also betrays an underlying defensiveness about flouting the conventional relationship between sex and gender.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, by contrast, the idea of gender being in opposition to anatomy was much less fraught with anxiety. The greater degree of contemporary concern with changing one's sex is probably linked to the wider range of possibilities of reshaping the body that are available today. This is not, however, to suggest that there was no conceptual space for the idea of a sex change in the Middle Ages. For example, Francesa Canadé Sautman (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0029" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>) links <i>Le Roman de Silence</i> to <i>Yde et Olive</i> and <i>Tristan de Nanteuil</i>, two 14th-century texts in which the heroine adopts male identity and is later miraculously transformed into a man (pp. 202–208).</p>
<p>Moreover, Rudolf Dekker and Lotte van de Pol (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0009" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1989</a></span>) argue that there was a well-founded practice of female-to-male cross-dressing in early modern Europe. They maintain that masquerading as a man was a viable option for women who had fallen on hard times and were struggling to overcome their difficulties. Furthermore, the pressures that led a woman to cross-dress could be either material, such as poverty, or emotional, such as patriotism or love for another woman, or a combination of the two (pp. 1–2). Furthermore, Vern L. Bullough (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0003" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>) argues that in the Middle Ages female cross-dressing was not only accepted but even encouraged because it was assumed that women who wore male garb were striving to become more like men, which was a laudable goal in a period that valued the masculine over the feminine (p. 225). This attitude was due in part to the strong tradition of female saints who denied their biological femininity to live as men (Bullough, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0003" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>, p. 229). Male cross-dressing, on the other hand, was deeply suspect, in part because in dressing as women, men were voluntarily assuming a lower status and in part because medieval writers could only conceive of dishonorable reasons for such a practice, namely, to facilitate access to women for sexual purposes (Bullough, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0003" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>, p. 225).</p>
<p>On the surface, the two examples of gender transgression in <i>Le Roman de Silence</i> fit into these medieval understandings of why someone might assume a gender contrary to his or her biological sex. Our first example is, of course, that of the main character, Silence; the second is that of an unknown man dressed as a nun who hides in the queen's retinue. The man who assumes the identity of a nun does so for purposes that are both opportunistic and nefarious. He is secretly the queen's lover and his disguise grants him more or less unimpeded access to her.</p>
<p>The case of Silence, however, is more complicated. Although her assumption of male identity is also motivated by pragmatism, it is not voluntary; rather, it is engineered and imposed by her father at the moment of her birth. Its main purpose, as Sharon Kinoshita (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0019" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1995</a></span>) points out, is to secure her family's lineage (p. 402). Moreover, as we see later, her success at performing masculinity exacts a deep psychic price. It is precisely this aspect of Silence's gender transformation that can elucidate the cracks and fissures in the contemporary construction of transsexuality.</p>
<p>The difference in the outcomes of Silence's deception and that of the nun also reveals the patriarchal bias that Bullough (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0003" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>) argues informed the medieval conception of gender. Silence and the nun both disguise themselves as members of the opposite sex for the same purpose, to defy the king's authority, but whereas Silence's transgression is forgiven to such an extent that the king reinstates female inheritance as a reward for her virtue, the nun is executed. Silence's actions are tolerable because Heldris characterizes her assumed masculinity as the external expression of her virtuous character. The nun's assumption of female garb, on the other hand, is geared solely toward enabling his treachery and lust.</p>
<p>This medieval suspicion of men who assume female identity continues today in the medical and scientific discourses of transsexuality. Indeed, as Judith Shapiro (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0030" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>) points out, because man still functions as the archetype for humanity in the contemporary gender hierarchy, women who want to be men can be seen as engaging in an understandable project of self-improvement. “Insofar as becoming more like a man is becoming more like a person, the implications for gender reclassification are less radical than movement away from the unmarked, generic human standard” (p. 270). Men who want to become women, on the other hand, disrupt the gender hierarchy because they would seem to willfully engage in an act of downward mobility (Shapiro, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0030" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. 270). The anxiety caused by the threat that such men pose to the gender hierarchy is reflected in the higher degree of scientific and theoretical interest accorded to male-to-female transsexuals.</p>
<p>The privileging of male-to-female over female-to-male experience in psychoanalysis derives from Freud's<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>7</sup>
</a></span> late Victorian view of family relations. This model, based on a nuclear family in which women are responsible for the majority of childcare, stresses the bond between mother and child as the central feature in the development of the child's gender identity. The existence of this bond provides a more coherent explanation of male transsexuality than it does of female transsexuality. Robert Stoller (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0032" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1968</a></span>), the first researcher to theorize a transsexual structure, for example, argued that because of the inherent difficulty of the break boys must make from their mother's femininity in order to develop their own masculine identity, they were more predisposed to becoming transsexuals than girls. The etiology of female transsexuality, however, is different. Rather than a parallel development, Stoller theorized that female transsexuality depended on a girl's identification with her father (pp. 263–268).
</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis is thus more suited to theorize a structure of male-to-female transsexuality than it is of female-to-male transsexuality. Millot (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>), for example, is interested in drawing a “blue-print” of female transsexuality, but she herself admits there is much less interest in female transsexuality than in male because female transsexuals are much less spectacular (p. 105). The very structure of her book points to this inequality in research. As well as using historical and cultural examples, her discussion of male transsexuality relies heavily on Lacanian theory, the structure of which supports the development of male, rather than female, transsexuals and on Stoller's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0032" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1968</a></span>) own research, which is based on years of clinical work with male-to-female transsexuals. When it comes to female transsexuality, however, there is no body of theoretical and empirical research to which she can turn. She relies instead on personal interviews upon which to construct her own theory.</p>
<p>This inequality is also echoed in the difference between the manner in which female-to-male and male-to-female transsexuals construct their own relationship with science. For example, in his book <i>Second Skins</i>, Jay Prosser (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>), a female-to-male transsexual, defends the validity of the transsexual's recourse to surgery. He argues that the body is an essential component of gender. Rather than conceiving of subjectivity as arising from the mutual interaction between mind and body, a point of view maintained by theorists such as Elizabeth Grosz (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0013" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>), for example, he insists, in a manner consistent with a Cartesian model of subjectivity, that the body must be made to conform to the mind: “Not residing wholly in the imaginary, sex must be felt in the body, must find its externalization, its substantiation, in material flesh” (Prosser, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>, p. 86).</p>
<p>Despite his defense of transsexuals' turn to surgery, however, Prosser (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>) is not insensitive to the power dynamics of the relationship between the doctor and the transsexual. In order to qualify for gender-reassignment surgery, transsexuals must edit their case histories to fit the doctor's expectations. Prosser argues that this imperative is reflected in the shared narrative trajectory of most transsexual autobiographies. These works conventionally move from suffering and confusion to self-discovery and finally resolution in the form of gender reassignment (p. 101). The reason for these similarities is that these autobiographies are deliberately tailored to meet doctors' expectations of what it feels like to be transsexed. Moreover, transsexuals who fail to live up to the model proposed by the medical establishment are usually refused surgery (Prosser, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>, p. 107).</p>
<p>This model derives from Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) work in <i>The Transsexual Phenomenon</i>. His key diagnostic category is the (male) transsexual's desire to remove his penis. He argues that true transsexuals find their sex organs, testes as well as penis, disgusting and describes transsexuals as asexual beings who, if they do masturbate, imagine themselves to be women when they do so (p. 19). He maintains that female-to-male transsexuals similarly view their preoperative bodies with loathing. They resent their breasts and frequently bind them until they can undergo a mastectomy. Likewise, they find menstruation deeply traumatic and are relived when it is suppressed under androgen therapy (pp. 149–150). Thus, Benjamin's model posits that both male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals unambiguously reject the bodies into which they are born.</p>
<p>His awareness of the coercion underpinning the relationship between the transsexual and the surgeon notwithstanding, Prosser (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>) staunchly defends the validity of the stereotype of the transsexual being trapped in the wrong body. He maintains that “transsexuals continue to deploy the image of wrong embodiment because being trapped in the wrong body is simply what transsexuality feels like” (p. 69). The male-to-female transsexual Sandy Stone (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>), by contrast, questions whether Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) model of transsexuality adequately reflects the transsexual's relationship with his or her anatomy. She argues that transsexuals do not passively await the judgment of medicine as to whether they meet the criteria for surgery. Instead, they deliberately reshape their experience of the body in order to fit the preconceptions of the medical establishment.</p>
<p>Benjamin's (1966) work was the first textbook on the subject of transsexuality and researchers used it as the standard reference in their evaluation of candidates for surgery. The behavior of transsexual patients matched the criteria set up by Benjamin and researchers interpreted this as proof of the validity of Benjamin's paradigm. What researchers failed to realize until much later, however, was that the reason male transsexuals adhered so closely to Benjamin's conditions was that they, too, were familiar with <i>The Transsexual Phenomenon</i> and used it as a model for their interactions with the medical community in order to enhance their chances of qualifying for surgery (Stone, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. 291).</p>
<p>Stone (1991) argues that the transsexual's sense of alienation toward his or her natal genitalia is more of a response to the medical prohibition against somatic self-acceptance than the actuality of transsexual experience. For example, in her discussion of <i>Connundrum</i> (1974), the autobiography of the male-to-female transsexual Jan Morris, she questions Morris's account of her last moments before undergoing surgery, specifically whether or not Morris might have masturbated as part of what Stone characterizes as the obligatory ceremony among male-to-female transsexuals. Stone maintains that for Morris to admit to this would have seriously undermined the medical justification for sex-change surgery (Stone, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. 292). As Califia (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) points out, “Medical people are unable to countenance castration or penectomy unless the genetic male in question eschews any penile pleasure and utterly rejects his “useless” organ” (p. 58). In Stone's estimation, for Morris to acknowledge this “most secret of secret traditions” would be to risk “role inappropriateness,” which would lead to disqualification (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. 292).</p>
<p>Part of the reason that Prosser (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0026" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1998</a></span>) and Stone (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>) characterize the transsexual's relationship with the doctor from such differing perspectives might stem from the fact that the stakes for male-to-female transsexuals are slightly different from those for female-to-male transsexuals. Male-to-female transsexuals such as Stone are overwhelmingly represented in medical and psychoanalytical literature. Indeed, it seems they are the preferred exemplar of transsexuality among both scientists and gender theorists.</p>
<p>Men who undergo a sex change might be more willing to question the psychic costs of surgical alteration than their female counterparts both because they occupy a more privileged position in academic as well as popular culture and because the surgery they undergo is more invasive. The surgical procedures for turning a man into a woman are both more advanced and more complicated than those for turning a woman into a man. As yet, although surgeons can create a functional vagina (with <i>functional</i> being defined as the ability to engage in heterosexual intercourse), they cannot create a functional penis. Thus, because male-to-female transsexuals typically undergo a greater degree of surgery than female-to-male transsexuals, it is not surprising that they would be more motivated to interrogate their relationship with medicine. Additionally, the greater visibility of male-to-female transsexuals provides them with the opportunity to construct more coherent networks of support and, as a consequence, they are better positioned to tear down the system in which they are implicated.</p>
<p>Benjamin's (1966) criteria that the transsexual feel nothing but disgust for the sexual organs with which he or she was born is part of the attempt of the medical establishment to contain transsexual sexuality. He lists four motives behind the desire of male-to-female transsexuals to undergo sex-change surgery: the heterosexual desire of a woman to have sex with a man, the desire to live in the sex of preference despite the fact that an intimate or sexual relationship might be impossible, the fear of being exposed or arrested for impersonating a woman, and the desire of a genetic male with a feminine physique to end harassment caused by his appearance (pp. 113–114). The first two of these motives work to contain transsexual sexual appetites within a heteronormative framework. Motive one makes it clear that the only form of sexuality recognized is that of a heterosexual woman. (Benjamin's brief discussion of female-to-male transsexuals similarly constructs their desire as heterosexual.)<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0008" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>8</sup>
</a></span> Benjamin's second motive removes the threat of transsexual sex to an even further distance by making it clear that the transsexual might never be able to achieve heterosexual intimacy.
</p>
<p>Whether or not she is engaged in a certain degree of calculation as Stone (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>) asserts, Jan Morris (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0024" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>) certainly substantiates Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) first claim in her autobiography. Although she unashamedly admits to sexual experiences with other boys in her youth, she argues that her (then) male body precluded her from enjoying them: “For though my body often yearned to give, to yield, to open itself, the machine was wrong. It was made for another function, and I felt myself to be wrongly equipped” (p. 24). Moreover, she continually characterizes her sexual feelings for other men as those of a heterosexual woman and makes it clear that she did not consider her (preoperative) self homosexual (p. 35). Yet despite her self-identification as a woman trapped in a man's body, she is not willing to entertain the possibility of lesbianism in her relationship with the woman she married while she was still James Morris. Instead, she subsumes their sexual relations to their joint desire to have children (p. 65).</p>
<p>Mario Martino (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>), a female-to-male transsexual, also identifies himself as heterosexual. In his autobiography, <i>Emergence</i>, he is careful to dismiss the possibility that his sex change might have been motivated by his inability to accept his lesbian tendencies and describes his relationship with his wife as that of a man with a woman (p. 132). Like Morris (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0024" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>), he also describes his preoperative body as a barrier to sexual enjoyment: “Never did I use my vagina during lovemaking—always I attached and wore my false penis.…But no matter what I did, the picture remained imperfect” (Martino, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>, p. 134). His desire to engage in heterosexual intercourse is so strong that he undergoes a second operation to construct an artificial penis after the first fails, willingly shouldering both the additional financial costs and the risk of death.</p>
<p>It is tempting to interpret the similarities in the manner in which both Morris (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0024" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>) and Martino (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>) describe their sexual feelings and Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) model of transsexual desire as a consequence of the fact that both Morris and Martino purposely shape their accounts to fit Benjamin's paradigm. Morris was under Benjamin's care (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0024" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>, p. 67) and the Foreword to Martino's <i>Emergence</i> was written by Benjamin himself (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>, p. ix). Suggestively, the importance that they both place on having the appropriate body in order to enjoy sexual relations is echoed the autobiographical profile of the female-to-male transsexual, Joe, that Benjamin includes in <i>The Transsexual Phenomenon</i>.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0009" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>

</a></span>

</p>
<p>Yet to say that transsexuals shape their narratives to conform to medical discourse is not to imply that there is a “real” account of the transsexual's relationship to his or her biology that is edited fit the medical criteria for sex-change surgery. As Judith Butler (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0004" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>) points out, our experience of the body is always constituted through culture. There is no such thing as a pure materiality untouched by discourse. We can only ever experience our anatomy in an already culturally mediated way (pp. 10–11). The close parallels between the accounts of Morris (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0024" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1974</a></span>) and Martino (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1977</a></span>) and Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) construction of transsexuality does not preclude the existence of a core of sincerity at the heart of their autobiographical accounts.</p>
<p>Heldris's treatment of desire is similar to Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) in that he, too, is unwilling to confront the possibility of a nonheteronormative sexuality. The episode that makes this clear, the queen's failed attempt to seduce Silence, is foregrounded by the crisis of identity Silence suffers on the brink of puberty. As soon as she is old enough to understand, her father explains the nature of the deception he has engineered and although she obediently continues it, she becomes increasingly troubled by the pangs of her conscience. Finally, when she is 12, an allegorized Nature appears and chastises her for her masculine ways. As Silence begins to be swayed, Nurture appears and routs Nature. A third figure, Reason, enters and points out that by living as a man, Silence can both experience the glories of knighthood and preserve her patrimony. As tempting as these considerations are, however, she is also driven to maintain her male identity by her fear of heterosexual intercourse.</p>
<p>She doubts that she would be able to participate in an act that, as Ruth Mazzo Karras (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0018" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>) points out, was divided into distinct masculine and feminine roles in the Middle Ages:
<div class="quote">

</p>
<p>Her contention that she is a “vallés,” a young man, rather than a “mescine,” a maiden, lies at the heart of her misgivings. Her fear that her body is inadequate to perform as a woman under the sheets is paralleled by her ignorance about heterosexual relations, an ignorance, moreover, that she rather puzzlingly attributes to her masculine upbringing. In her own estimation, her extraordinary nurturing places her outside the realm of sexuality.</p>
<p>Indeed, her self-proclaimed exclusion from desire becomes realized in her encounter with the amorous queen, Eufeme. When Silence first enters the king's service, Eufeme falls in love with her. She arranges for them to be alone, then disrobes and offers herself to the young knight:
<div class="quote">

</p>
<p>Eufeme possesses the tender white flesh that is an integral part of women's beauty in courtly romance, but her body has no effect on Silence. Heldris attributes this disinterest to Silence's nature: “Mais cil nen a de tolt cho cure / Car nel consent pas sa nature” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 178, ll. 3822–3823).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0012" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>12</sup>
</a></span> Peggy McCracken (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0021" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>) points out that <i>nature</i> in this work has many meanings, including anatomy, moral temperament, noble breeding, “and even the status quo of gender roles.”Heldris's use of <i>nature</i> in this context, however, equates the term with heterosexuality. Silence is not attracted to the queen because the “true” nature, beneath her perverted upbringing, is female. Moreover, because nature ultimately triumphs over nurture, Heldris's invocation of the term effectively removes his heroine from the possibility of homoerotic attraction. In an echo of Benjamin's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>) attempt to construct transsexual desire as heterosexual, Heldris refuses to allow the possibility that Silence's socialization might have masculinized her to the extent that she would assume a male sexual orientation.
</p>
<p>Yet it is clear that Silence's nurturing has not prepared her for heterosexuality. Indeed, the fear of sex that she expressed as a child seems to have developed into a type of sexual anesthesia. Her reaction to Eufeme's proposal, for example, deflects the issue of sex to more material considerations. The only concerns to which we are privy are her potential disloyalty to the king, who is both her lord and her uncle (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 178, ll. 3805–3806), and her fear that her secret might be discovered (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 182, ll. 3871–3873).</p>
<p>Her eventual marriage to the king is similarly sexless. The question of her desire is completely ignored. Indeed, in his discussion of the marriage, Heldris focuses on everyone except his heroine. He first explains that the king's decision to marry his niece was motivated “Par loëment de ses princhiers” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 312, ll. 6679–6680),<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0013" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>13</sup>
</a></span> then he discusses the joy of Silence's parents at the union. About Silence, however, he is silent. We are given no indication of her feelings about this marriage to her uncle, a man with whom all her former dealings have been on a strictly male-to-male basis. We do not even know whether she marries him of her own volition.
</p>
<p>This omission on Heldris's part fits in with his larger characterization of his heroine as someone who is largely constructed by the desire of others. Indeed, the core of the romance, Silence's assumption of male identity, depends, at least initially, on her denial of subjectivity. Although she follows without protest her father's injunction to pass herself off as a boy, her submission comes at the cost of emotional trauma. The battle between Nature and Nurture, for example, is precipitated by the conflict between her desire to obey her father and her abhorrence of practicing deception: “Silences forment s'enasprist, / Car ses corages li aprist / K<i>e</i> s<i>i</i> fesist par couverture” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 116, ll. 2497–2499).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0014" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>14</sup>
</a></span>

</p>
<p>It is this suppression of self that differentiates Silence's experience from late 20&nbsp;h-century transsexuals. Contemporary transsexuals are adults who choose to be assigned to the gender with which they identify. Silence, on the other hand, is made into a boy at her parents' instigation. This denial of her agency draws her case more closely to the modern treatment of intersexed children than it does to transsexuality.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, children born with genitalia considered sexually ambiguous were usually subjected to medical and chromosomal treatments to “normalize” their anatomy. In practice this meant altering their genitals and sexual organs to conform to the sex that the surgeon decided the infant most closely resembled (Hausman, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0015" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>, p. 1). In the 1990s the medical community began to reconsider this practice as the result of a follow-up study of a case of twin boys, one of whom, known by the pseudonym “Joan/John,” lost his penis in a botched operation to rectify a problem with his foreskin when he was an infant. Advised by Dr. John Money, John's parents decided to have their baby undergo clinical castration and to raise him as a girl.<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0015" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>15</sup>
</a></span>

</p>
<p>Money's scientific publications reported that John's gender reassignment was completely successful, but John denied this. He recalled knowing even as a young child that he was not a girl: “You know generally what a girl is like…and you know generally what a guy is like. And everyone is telling you that you're a girl. But you say to yourself, ‘I don't <i>feel</i> like a girl'” (Colapinto, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>). Indeed, John never seemed to adjust to his feminine identity; he suffered from numerous academic and social problems at school and was depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. When he was 14 he stopped the estrogen treatment on which he had been placed, began to wear only male clothing, and let his hair become dirty and matted. When he was 15, his parents revealed the truth of his identity and he immediately decided to undergo a sex change. He began taking male hormones and before he was 16, he had undergone a double mastectomy and had a rudimentary penis constructed (Colapinto, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>16</sup>
</a></span>

</p>
<p>The common consensus of the scientific community was that his gender reassignment failed because he was obeying the imperative of his original physiology, but Bernice Hausman (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0015" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>) suggests that John was unwilling to be a girl because of the pressure exerted on him by his parents and his surgeons to conform to their rigid notion of femininity (p. 6). Indeed, Butler's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>) description of John's annual visits to Baltimore makes clear the enormity of the coercion to which he was subjected:
<div class="quote">
<p class="first last">John/Joan was intensely monitored by psychological teams throughout childhood and adolescence, that teams of doctors observed Joan's behavior, that teams of doctors asked her and her brother to disrobe in front of them so that genital development could be gauged, that there was a doctor who asked her to engage in mock-coital exercises with her brother, to view the pictures, to know and to want the so-called normalcy of unambiguous genitalia [p. 629].</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>From infancy, John's relationship with his flesh was determined by the doctors and psychologists who constantly scrutinized him and when he finally claimed control of his body, he was forced to turn to the very science that had used him to satisfy its curiosity. John became an object of scientific discourse through an accident, but his powerlessness is identical to the lack of control suffered by children born with ambiguous genitalia to determine their gender.</p>
<p>Intersex is not a modern phenomenon. Indeed, this condition was known from antiquity and was a topic of great scientific and popular interest in the 17th and 18th centuries (Dekker and van de Pol <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0009" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1989</a></span>, p. 50). Michael McVaugh (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0022" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>), for example, discusses the 14th-century medical examination of a certain Berengaria Castelló, whose husband, Guillem, sought to divorce her because she “‘could not fulfill her conjugal debt nor conceive nor bear a child'” (p. 206). The surgeon found that
<div class="quote">
<p class="first last">she has a male penis and testicles like a man; and is so narrow that she can barely urinate through an opening that she has in a fissure that she has in the vulva, [a fissure] that lies beneath her penis; and has a flap stretched beneath her thighs like the wings of a bat, which covers the fissure in the vulva whenever she draws her knees toward her head; and she has more the aspect of a man than a woman, and there is no way in which Guillem or any other man can lie with her [p. 206].</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>Given this detailed description of her genitals, it seems rather odd that Berengaria would be identified as a woman rather than as a man, but Dekker and van de Pol (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0009" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1989</a></span>) offer a possible explanation. They argue that intersexed children were raised as either male or female, depending on which sex they most closely resembled, but if a child developed secondary sexual characteristics of the opposite sex during puberty, he or she would be forced to change gender (p. 50). Perhaps Berengaria's masculine characteristics only developed after she had already been identified as a woman and socialized to be female.</p>
<p>Despite these social mechanisms to integrate intersexed individuals, however, Joan Cadden (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>) points out that the medieval response to intersex, or hermaphroditism, as it was known, was generally reductionistic and hostile. Because hermaphrodites destabilized the dichotomy between male and female, they were viewed as rebellious and destructive. Medieval thinkers sought to restrict the excesses of their bodies by reducing the traits and behaviors of a particular hermaphrodite to permutations of the conventional categories of masculine and feminine (Cadden, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0006" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>, p. 212).</p>
<p>The medieval hermaphrodite cannot elucidate the construction of gender in <i>Silence</i> because the scarcity of medieval literature concerning hermaphrodites effectively limits our ability to explore the ways in which they experienced their condition. By contrast, the modern category of intersex, under which I subsume the experience of John/Joan, can deepen our understanding of Heldris's extraordinary romance. Whereas the medieval hermaphrodite appears to us only briefly and usually from the perspective of the authority who surveys his or her body, the contemporary paradigm of intersex allows intersexed persons to speak for themselves. Within the last 10 years, intersex has changed from being the sole province of scientists and doctors. Intersexed individuals such as Cheryl Chase, an advocate for intersex rights, for example, challenge the medical presumption of authority over their identities and discuss their experiences of gender from the position of subject rather than object. Their insights can deepen our understanding of the effects of Silence's upbringing.</p>
<p>Like John/Joan, Silence is raised in the gender contrary to her sex. From the day of her birth, she is dressed as a boy and treated as such. As a child, she engages solely in male activities, such as riding, hunting, and wrestling. Unlike John, Silence seemingly participates in her forced gendering eagerly: “Quant il joent a le palaistre, / A bohorder, n'a l'escremir, / Il seus fait tols ses pers fremir” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 116, ll. 2494–2496).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0017" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>17</sup>
</a></span> Even though she overcomes her initial misgivings about the deception her father wants her to practice, when she reaches puberty, she is again racked by doubt and when minstrels visit her father's court, she decides to run away and join them. Perhaps like John, her hormones started to change her body in ways that belied her putative gender<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0018" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>18</sup>
</a></span> or perhaps the minstrels offered a possibility that Silence had never before considered, that of escaping her enforced identity. She does continue to live as a man when she is with the minstrels, but their wandering life must certainly have been less restrictive than her previous one in which her every action was scrutinized for fear that she might betray her femaleness.

</p>
<p>Silence's justification for running away is rather curious—she views it as an opportunity to learn the musical skills that would be useful to her were she to ever live as a woman, a point to which I return. Yet we cannot help but wonder if, like John, she is oppressed by the burden of parental expectation. Part of the reason that she persisted in her assumed male identity was, after all, her desire to please father.</p>
<p>During her first crisis of identity, allegorized as the battle between Nature and Nurture, she weighs the benefits of continuing to pass herself off as a boy: “Ne voel perdre ma grant honor, / Ne la voel cangier a menor. / Ne voel mon pere desmentir” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 124, ll. 2651–2653).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0019" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>19</sup>
</a></span> The parallel construction of the lines, each of which begins with “ne…voel,” I do not wish, would seem to indicate that maintaining the social superiority that she enjoys as male is as important to her as preserving her father's honor, but the placement of “Ne voel mon pere desmentir” at the end of this triplet suggests that it is her father's position, rather than her own, with which she is most concerned. On the most superficial level, as the arrangement of these lines visually demonstrates, her own honor lies on the bedrock of her father's. Exposing her secret would thus destroy both his relationship with the king and her own chances of advancement. Yet these calculations aside, Silence is still a child worrying about the fate of her parent. He has already explained to her that he is deliberately perpetuating a fraud; she understands that revealing this fraud would have dire consequences for him as well as her.
</p>
<p>Despite her acceptance of her father's will and her apparent facility with the pursuits of boyhood, however, her feelings toward her upbringing are ambivalent. The name she chooses for herself, “Malduit,” meaning wrongly raised, reveals her resentment: “A cort se fait nomer Malduit, / Car il se tient moult por mal duit, / Moult mal apris lonc sa nature” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 148, ll. 3177–3179).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0020" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>20</sup>
</a></span> This negative assessment of her childhood bespeaks a certain level of alienation and loneliness.
</p>
<p>Just like John/Joan's enforced girlhood, Silence's passing as a man exacts a heavy price. Instead of growing up in court as would be normal for someone of her background, she is raised in secrecy in the woods with only her father's cousin and his seneschal for company. Moreover, Silence does not appear to have any emotional bonds with anyone. After handing her infant daughter over to be raised by a distant relation, her mother fades from her life. Her father is certainly more involved, but his interventions are geared mainly at supervising the degree to which she has become masculinized. As a young teenager, she lives abroad for a number of years with the minstrels, who regard her with jealous suspicion, and when she does return to her father's land, she immediately joins the king's court. She is completely emotionally isolated. Indeed, the only personal encounter we see is when the queen tries to seduce her and, as we have already mentioned, the only aspect of Silence's feelings that Heldrisdiscusses is her fear of discovery.</p>
<p>It is this emotional victimization that finally marks the distance between our medieval heroine and modern intersexed individuals. People like Chase, who founded and directs the Intersex Society of North America, refuse to be coerced by scientific definitions of “normal” and demand the right to determine the shape of their bodies (Butler, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span> p. 626). Chase has been campaigning with increasing success for deferring the practice of performing surgery on children born with ambiguous genitalia until they are old enough to make an informed decision themselves (<a href="http://www.isna.org" target="_blank">http://www.isna.org</a>.).</p>
<p>Other intersexed individuals question the rhetorical uses to which their bodies and experiences have been put. Hanna Miyamoto, for example, critiques the manner in which feminist debates about gender ignore the subjectivity of intersexed people in favor of using them as figures of discourse (H. Miyamoto, personal communication, May 21, 2010). Even though he eventually committed suicide, John/Joan also fought for his own identity on terms different from those established by the medical community. Indeed, Butler (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>) interprets his unwillingness as a child to answer Money's questions about his sexual desires as an attempt to preserve his subjectivity: “He thinks something more of himself than what others think, he does not fully justify his worth through recourse to what he has between his legs, and he does not think of himself as a complete loser” (p. 633). Furthermore, his decision to cooperate with Milton's follow-up study was driven by the desire to prevent the type of surgeries performed on him from being performed on other children (Colapinto, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0008" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>).</p>
<p>Silence, by contrast, is ultimately denied any form of subjectivity. Apart from the two crises in her childhood, there is no indication that she has any desire to create an identity of her own. Indeed, after she returns to her father's court, Heldrisnever again explores her feelings toward her imposed male identity. He ultimately reduces his heroine to a cipher whose only meaning is that imposed from without—by her father, by the queen, by the king, and by Merlin. His treatment of his heroine resembles the manner in which psychoanalysis objectifies both intersexed individuals and transsexuals.</p>
<p>Although intersexed individuals receive very little attention in psychoanalytical literature, psychoanalysis seems to share the tendency of science to assume ownership of intersexed bodies. Gayle Salamon's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0028" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>) discussion of transgenderism, “The Bodily Ego and the Contested Domain of the Material,” exemplifies Miyamoto's (2010) critique of the manner in which intersexed individuals are reduced to rhetorical figures. Salamon (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0028" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2004</a></span>) focuses on Freud's discussion of hermaphroditism and like Freud, her interest in intersexed people never extends beyond using them to elucidate the question of object choice and sexual identity (p. 98). Her lack of interest in intersexed persons as subjects is part of a larger tendency in psychoanalysis. Perhaps because intersexual bodies disrupt the relationship that psychoanalysis posits between body and identity, psychoanalysis is uninterested in theorizing the psychic structure of intersexual minds.</p>
<p>Even though they are discussed in far more detail, transsexuals are treated in a similarly reductionistic fashion. For example, Califia (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) points out the exploitative and dehumanizing aspects of Millot's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>) <i>Horsexe</i>: “‘The transsexual’ is held at a distance from ‘the reader,’ and because of that distance, it is of course safe for the reader to say anything she likes about her remote subject” (Califia,<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0007" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>, p. 110). Califia argues that such treatment, rather than being unique to psychoanalysis, is typical of the manner in which contemporary learned culture treats the transsexual:
<div class="quote">
<p class="first last">In autobiographical or fictional accounts, they [transsexuals] may set down what they perceive to be true about themselves and the world around them, but it is the medical doctor, therapist, academic, and feminist theoretician who interpret “them” for the rest of “us,” and thus claim to be the voice of reality [p. 1–2].</p>
</div>
</p>
<p>This attempt to fix the meaning of transsexual narratives rests on the assumption that transsexuals are either unequipped or unwilling to reveal the truth of their condition.</p>
<p>This idea that there is an instability at the core of transsexuality is similar to the manner in which Heldris constructs Silence's gender. We have previously mentioned Silence's rather curious justification for running away with the minstrels—she sees it as an opportunity to learn skills that would be useful to her if she were to become a woman again. Her reasoning is plausible: “S'il avenoit del roi Ebayn / Que il morust hui u demain / Feme raroit son iretage” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 132, ll. 2831–2833).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0021" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>21</sup>
</a></span> Yet this very possibility reveals Silence's gender insecurity. She cannot become too attached to her male identity because she might be expected to forfeit it at any moment, while at the same time she cannot be secure in her femininity because she has been socialized to be a man. When considering whether to run away with the minstrels, for example, one of her considerations is her potential inability to be convincingly feminine: “Et tu iés ore si salvage, / Ne sai a us de feme entendre” (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 132, ll. 2834–2835).<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref fn"><a data-rid="FN0022" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="fn" data-label="footnote"><span class="off-screen">Footnote</span>
<sup>22</sup>
</a></span>


</p>
<p>McCracken (1994) also points out that unlike the heroines of <i>Yde et Olive</i> and <i>Tristan de Nanteuil</i>, the two other texts that also deal with the heroine's assumption of male identity, Silence does not change her sex to accommodate her gender. McCracken connects this lack of anatomical transformation to the ambiguity that surrounds Silence's identity. She also reads Silence's name as symptomatic of the gender instability that plagues this heroine. Silence's father christens his daughter with the masculine “Scilentius,” reasoning that if the truth were ever discovered, her name could be changed to the feminine form, “Scilentia.” Tellingly, our heroine foregoes both forms of this name and calls herself by the neuter form, “Scilence” (McCracken, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0021" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>).</p>
<p>This inability to fully conceive of herself as either male or female further separates Silence from both modern transsexuals and intersexed people. Transsexuals advocate that they were always aware of their true gender in spite of their anatomies whereas children born with ambiguous genitalia are usually assigned to a gender as soon as possible. Indeed, although the Intersex Society of North America radically disagrees with the age at which surgeries are performed on the basis of these assignations, it supports the practice of assigning intersexed infants to a gender identity (<a href="http://www.isna.org/" target="_blank">http://www.isna.org/</a>). Thus unlike contemporary intersexed individuals and transsexuals, Silence is completely outside the system of gender.</p>
<p>Her exclusion would seem to make Heldris's system of gender more radical than our own. Yet ultimately he is unwilling to think beyond a binary model. As Elizabeth Waters (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0034" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) points out, Silence, who is unsurpassed in her valor as a knight and her obedience as a woman, succeeds at being both a man and a woman to such an extent that the categories of male and female are insufficient to contain her (p. 45). Heldris, however, is unable to countenance the disruption of gender categories caused by his heroine's hypersufficiency and he definitively recategorizes her so that her gender conforms to her biology.</p>
<p>His desire to restrict the meaning of Silence's identity stems from the same present-day discomfort with the figure of the transsexual and with intersex, which lies behind the attempts of medicine and science to force these individuals into normative categories of male and female. If, for example, a man feels himself to be a woman in defiance of his anatomy, his body must be changed to agree with this conviction. Moreover, the medical criteria for evaluating “true” transsexuals are based on a strictly binary model of gender. One can be either male or female and one must belong to one category only. Individuals whose gender identities are not deemed to match their biology can be “normalized” through surgery, a move that, as Shapiro (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0030" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>) points out, leaves the two-gender system unchallenged (p. 251). This attachment to a binary gender system also justifies the surgeries that are performed on intersexed children despite the fact that these “normalizing” surgeries, clitoral reductions and penectomies, effectively rob the child of the possibility of erotic sensation.</p>
<p>Anne Fausto-Sterling (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0010" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2000</a></span>) points out the degree to which scientific knowledge is shaped by culture. She argues that all knowledge scientists produce about sex is already affected, to varying degrees of consciousness, by their beliefs about gender (p. 3). Moreover, medical knowledge empowers doctors to maintain a mythology of the “normal” by changing bodies that do not fit into the gender binary into either male or female (p. 8). That is, the knowledge produced by the medical establishment puts doctors and scientists in a privileged position vis-à-vis the body. Because these professionals have access to privileged knowledge, it is assumed that whatever they say about the body must necessarily be more informed and thus more authoritative than pronouncements made by the general population.</p>
<p>Fausto-Sterling (2000) is not suggesting that the medical establishment deliberately coerces society to adhere to its gender standards. Rather, she posits that scientists are preconditioned to view the human body in a specific way. This then determines the meaning and value they place on bodies that do not adhere to these standards. In turn, their strictures about the proper relationship between sex and gender reinforce the social stereotypes by which they themselves were conditioned. By granting surgical alterations to transsexuals and surgically altering the bodies of intersexed children, medicine can thus control the threat these bodies pose to its essentialist view of gender and shore up its own authority as the arbiter of the body.</p>
<p>Like modern science, the conclusion of <i>Le Roman de Silence</i> also seems to equate body and gender, but Silence's final transformation is undercut with ambiguity. Heldris attributes Silence's refeminization to the unavoidable power of Nature but both McCracken (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0021" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>) and Regina Psaki (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0027" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>) interpret Nature's victory as unconvincing. McCracken points out that despite the fact that after the king examines Silence's naked body and declares her to be female (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 308, ll. 6572–6574), it still takes Nature 3 days to remove the traces of masculinity from her flesh: “The ‘truth’ of Silence's anatomy does not appear to be self-evident at all” (n.p.). Psaki, on the other hand, argues that the romance's conventional ending does little to negate the radical events that preceded it: “Commonplaces about biological and social gender have still been shaken, and the pat ending with its pat commentary do not successfully repair the rift in the conceptual fabric” (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0027" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>, p. xxxii).</p>
<p>Additionally, the marriage between Silence and her uncle further undermines the romance's “pat ending.” Lorraine Kochanske Stock (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0031" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) points out that because Silence's return to femininity erases the very qualities that make her so extraordinary, the chances of her marriage succeeding are slim. The characteristics the king admired and valued in the old “masculine” Silence—courage, physical strength, and feudal loyalty—have no place in her newly feminized persona (p. 27). Kinoshita (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0019" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1995</a></span>) also raises the fact that the king deliberately flouts canon law in order to divert the family wealth of his great-niece into his own coffers (p. 406). His blasé attitude toward incest contrasts to Silence's own horror at the thought of having sex with the queen, a relative by marriage. When the queen first tries to seduce the young knight, Silence tries to extricate herself by citing the loyalty she owes to the king, both as his liege man and as his blood relation (Heldris de Cornuälle, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0016" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1999</a></span>, p. 178, ll. 3806–3807). Elizabeth Archibald (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0001" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>) also mentions that accusations of incest were commonly leveled against tyrants in order to blacken their characters (p. 18). The fact that the incest theme was frequently used by clerical writers in the Middle Ages probably ensured that Heldris was familiar with the connection between incest and bad government. The king, as Stock (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0031" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1997</a></span>) points out, is certainly a weak ruler at best. She argues that from the outset of the romance, his reign is marked by impetuousness (which we see in the ban in female inheritance, which he immediately rescinds to enable his nephew to marry a Cornish heiress) and his ineptitude (which becomes explicit when he has to rely on Silence to put down an uprising among his own vassals; pp. 9–13).</p>
<p>The conclusion of Heldris's romance thus complicates the relationship he posits between body and gender. Although he explicitly maintains the defining power of anatomy, his ending seems to contradict this assertion. He does not, however, deny the necessity of existing within gender. Silence's experience ultimately points to the terrible price of being neither male nor female, a condition that Millot (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0023" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1983</a></span>) describes as “outsidesex.” Millot uses this term to describe Gabriel, a female-to-male transsexual. After undergoing numerous sex-change surgeries, Gabriel has come to the conclusion that he is neither male nor female. Indeed, he argues that most female-to-male transsexuals feel the same way as he does and that their assumption of male identity is merely a pretense (pp. 129–130).</p>
<p>We do not, however, know how Silence feels about changing from male to female. Despite her conclusion as a child that it is better to be a man than a woman, she obediently gives up her masculinity when her secret is discovered. As McCracken (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0021" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1994</a></span>) points out, Silence does not repeat earlier claims to masculine features nor does she mention her confusion about gender identity that she demonstrated in the earlier debates between Nature and Nurture. Her silence at the end of the text speaks of her inability to frame an authentic self, an inability, moreover, that undermines her entire life.</p>
<p>This lack of authenticity resembles a condition that Stone (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0033" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1991</a></span>), in her discussion of transsexuals, characterizes as the price of passing. Stone points out that the mark of a successful postoperative transsexual is precisely that he or she leave no mark. That is, a successful transsexual should be indistinguishable from a genetic male or female (p. 296). Stone argues that this act of “passing” requires the transsexual to negate his or her preoperative identity and because most transsexuals choose reassignment surgery in their 30s or 40s, they must deny a considerable portion of their past (pp. 296–297). This denial, based on omissions and deliberate deception, forecloses the possibility of having an authentic relationship (p. 298). Throughout her life, Silence seems to undergo something analogous to “passing.” As a man, the necessity of guarding her secret demands that she remain emotionally isolated whereas her final transformation into a woman both robs her of the little agency she had enjoyed and demands that she deny the skills and experiences that have so far formed her identity.</p>
<p class="last">Heldris's construction of gender resonates with contemporary debates about transsexuals and intersexed individuals because he brings the question of the relationship between body and gender to center stage. His inability to definitively resolve this question suggests that the binary system of gender to which we ascribe is insufficient to encompass the totality of human experience. Moreover, the gradual effacing of his heroine's agency makes clear the dehumanizing pressure of too ardent a pressure to conform to gender norms.</p>

<sup>9</sup>“In my so-called daydreaming, I have often visualized the satisfaction I would derive from possessing a penis and in being able to perform normal intercourse with a woman rather than engage in homosexual acts” (Benjamin, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0002" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1966</a></span>, p. 246).</p>

<sup>15</sup>Joan's case is a vivid illustration of how gender, in Adrienne Harris's (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0014" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2005</a></span>) terms, is “assembled.” The femininity imposed on him was comprised of overlapping factors that themselves stem from socially constructed notions of what it means to be either male or female: the loss of his penis, his parents' desperation, and the pressure exerted by the medical team supervising him to surgically and psychologically turn him into a “normal” girl.</p>

<sup>16</sup>The warning that Butler (<span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0004" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>1993</a></span>) raises in <i>Bodies that Matter</i> is no less relevant in John's case. Despite her desire to respect his narrative, here too, she points out the naivety of uncritically accepting the manner in which he presents his early childhood experiences (Butler, <span class="ref-lnk lazy-ref bibr"><a data-rid="CIT0005" href="#" data-behaviour="toggle-ref" data-ref-type="bibr" data-label="reference"><span class="off-screen">Citation</span>2001</a></span>, pp. 629–630). John's unhappy childhood and anger when he discovered the truth no doubt influences the degree to which he represents his early engendering as brutally coercive.</p>
