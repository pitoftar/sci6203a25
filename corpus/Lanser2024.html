<p>ONCE UPON A TIME, a fictional character named Silence was born as a girl and raised as a boy. This happened circumstantially, for Silence was an only child in a land whose king forbade daughters to inherit their father’s lands. Nature and Nurture battle for primacy within Silence, and although “in truth, he is a girl beneath his clothes” (<a name="b24-text" href="#b24" class="rid-text">Roche-Mahdi 6535–36</a>) the narrative proceeds to “make a man of him” (2473–74). “Nurture can do a great deal to overcome Nature,” the text promises, and indeed Silence becomes the bravest, smartest, and strongest of knights: “He was so used to men’s usage / and had so rejected women’s ways” the text playfully affirms, “that little was lacking for him to be a man. / Whatever one could see was certainly male!” (2475–78, my emphasis). In the end, unsurprisingly if disappointingly, Silence is exposed as a biological female and must marry the king. But rather than a simple change of clothing of the sort we find at the end of, say, Shakespeare’s <em>As You Like It</em>, here Nature must engage in three days of hard work to remove “every trace” from Silence’s “entire body” of “anything that being a man had left there” (6671–73).</p>
<p>The <em>Roman de Silence</em> that I am evoking here was written in the thirteenth century although the manuscript was only discovered, by happenstance, in 1911. I will return later to its reincarnation in a 2020 novel; for the moment I offer it as a reminder, if we need one, that trans narrative is nothing new. Trans <em>is</em> relatively new, however, as a conceptual category for textual analysis: a simple search of the 2021 MLA Bibliography on the combined terms “narrative” and “transgender” yielded only 52 entries, of which 42 were published within the last ten years. These are still fledgling numbers compared to the 625 entries for “narrative” and “queer” or even the 260 entries for “narrative” and “lesbian.”<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1" class="rid-fn-text">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If trans scholarship has lagged behind both trans-literature and trans-life, trans <em>narratology</em> has lagged behind the lag. This kind of lag is not a new phenomenon: like many ‘ologies’ that consider themselves scientific and universal, narratology has been slow to accept its own theorizing as historically and culturally contingent,<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text">2</a></sup> though the times are certainly changing now. Robyn Warhol and I have been offering the term “situated narratologies” to describe narrative theories that locate their inquiry in the context of social, cultural, and/or historical specificities. But we also note that <em>all</em> narratology is situated; it is just that classical narratology situated itself in what had been accepted as universal: heteronormative cisgendered novels written by white men. In calling for a feminist, and then a queer, and now a trans narratology, then, I am assuming that the texts we choose to study will shape the theories through which we study them just as much as the theories will illuminate the texts.</p>
<p>If we can agree that all narratives signify through their formal practices, and that narrative form can therefore be read as narrative content, then understanding trans narratives means considering not only what texts <em>say</em> but what they <em>do</em>. Interventions by Bernadette Calafell, Rachel Carroll, Kate Drabinski, Chiara Pellegrini, and by the contributors to this special issue, are already engaged in this project that Cáel Keegan identifies as “locating narrative structures that will adequately allow for the existence of trans* bodies and becomings” (387). My contribution to such efforts is necessarily provisional, since I speak as an outsider both to the field of trans studies and to the identity of trans. I thus take as my model the respectfully tentative approach advanced by Gerald Prince when he speculated that a postcolonial narratology might be “sensitive <strong> [End Page 216] </strong> to matters commonly, if not uncontroversially, associated with the postcolonial (e.g., hybridity, migrancy, otherness, fragmentation, diversity, power relations)” (373). I have likewise tried to attend here to some of the matters “commonly, if not uncontroversially” associated with trans narratives as I see them articulated in the preoccupations of the texts themselves. My speculations stem from my perspectives as a feminist and queer narratologist trained in (post)classical methodologies; I offer them as potentially useful to a trans narratology with the hope that a trans narratology will also yield a transformed one: a narratology that calls our attention to elements of narrative and narrative theory that conventional (cis)narratology has undervalued or ignored. In this way, a trans narratology would also speak back to, and modify, narratology <em>tout court</em>.</p>
<p>Toward this end, I focus here on some formal aspects of a group of novels published within the past decade that feature gender non-binary or gender-noncon-forming characters or that thematize gender nonconformity. Some of these novels are highly conventional and some are experimental, a useful range that should keep us from equating the modernity of trans-liberation with modernity of narrative form.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text">3</a></sup> I use these texts as touchstones, not as quantitative evidence for typical practices in trans literature. Among “matters commonly, if not uncontroversially, associated with” transgender, I would propose to include pronominal identity, refusal of binaries, otherness, concealment or passing, revelation or disclosure, danger and safety, and gender play. With these in mind, I will touch here on formal configurations of narrative voice, embodiment, character space, plotting, and closure in a group of recent British and American trans novels. I will not have space here to attend to questions of temporality, but matters of time necessarily permeate trans narrative to an extent worthy of an essay in itself.</p>
<p>I begin by thinking about narrative voice, a subject deeply pursued by Pellegrini in ways that I can only supplement. I call attention especially to the ways that trans narrative might exploit the freedom of the first-person pronoun. We are doubtless all aware of the enormous trans-capacity of the “I” in English, as opposed to the gender-specific third person singular—a grammatical benefit that is more and less true in other languages. Certainly texts with homodiegetic narrators—that is, I-narrators who are also characters—have the greatest latitude to refuse the binary order, and that factor, in addition of course to the affordances of intimacy and immediacy, may be one reason why so many trans novels use a first-person voice. Take, for example, Sara Taylor’s <em>The Lauras</em>, narrated by a teenager named Alex though focused primarily on the complex history of Alex’s mother. For almost two hundred pages, Alex’s gender goes almost wholly unmentioned even through contextual clues, potentially encouraging unaware readers to project Alex as “he” or “she” without much thought. Even when Alex is finally confronted, gender is acknowledged only to be denied: “sex I may have,” but “gender I do not have,” Alex insists; Alex is “either and neither and both at once” (231). Judging from reader reviews on both Amazon and Goodreads, <em>The Lauras</em> presents an interesting exercise in the likelihood that readers will automatically assign Alex a sex and corresponding gender early on. While the refusal of a cisgender binary can of course be signalled by the nonspecific singular “they,” a pronoun that narratology certainly needs to add to its repertoire, “they” already <strong> [End Page 217] </strong> signals gender nonconformity. In the case of <em>The Lauras</em>, by contrast, there is no hint for most of the novel that gender is even a concern. First-person narration arguably functions here as a lure, engaging the reader in false cis-gendered assumptions about a character with whom they probably also come to empathize and perhaps identify.</p>
<p>The use of homodiegetic voice can also track the narrative tension between proclaimed gender and embodied sex that shapes a plotline as significant to trans fiction as it is to trans life: the plot of passing that is charged with the pervasive possibility of violence. In Alex Myers’s <em>Continental Divide</em>, for instance, the narrator-protagonist Ron Bancroft lets us know early on that he has gone out to a Wyoming cattle ranch to test and strengthen his newly forged masculinity. His challenge, and the source of the novel’s primary conflict, is to pass as a man in this macho and almost certainly transphobic world. Right off, we find him hiding his tampons and breastbands, and later, we do see the violent aftermath of his exposure. Right off too, if through a different tonality, the protagonist of Zeyn Joukhadar’s <em>The Thirty Names of Night</em> visits a gynecologist seeking to stop having periods and conceals her breast-binding even at home.</p>
<p>In both of these novels, an external narratee serves as the narrator’s confidant, the one who knows the intimate truths that the narrator is hiding from inhabitants of the storyworld. In the first case that narratee is the reader, and thus a public, extradiegetic narratee; in the second case, the narratee is the deceased mother and thus a private recipient of the narrator’s confidences; but neither narratee can expose or endanger the narrator or act within the narrator’s world. Of course transness is not the only impetus for creating a secret world between a narrator and a narratee; we see a similar relationship, for example, in Charlotte Brontë’s <em>Jane Eyre</em>, whose narrator repeatedly discloses to her “dear reader” the thoughts and feelings she cannot share with those around her. In a 2018 essay focused on that novel, I proposed but did not explore three (historically shifting) forms of relationships between extradiegetic narrators and their narratees, which I called, respectively, impersonal, ironic, and intimate (<a name="b11-text" href="#b11" class="rid-text">“The Diachronization” 118–19</a>). Narratology has still engaged less with narratees than with narrators, and a trans narratology might take a leading role in thinking about the ways in which trans narrators address their narratees and how narrator-narratee relationships might propel or forestall empathy. Even when the narratee is only covertly represented, studying the narrator’s choices of language, of what to disclose and not to disclose, will tell us much about the implied relationship between narrator and audience. Intimacy is of course not the only option; certainly irony would characterize the mode in which the narrator of <em>Confessions of a Fox</em> addresses his narratee. It would also be worth asking not only what these various narratees are presumed to <em>know</em>, but who, in gender terms, they are presumed to <em>be</em>.</p>
<p>In contrast to <em>The Lauras</em>, in which Alex’s body is insistently not gendered for the reader even in a scene in which Alex describes being assaulted and stripped by a gang of high school boys (224–27), most of the novels in my sample mark an explicit distance between gender identity and gender assigned at birth. In so doing, they ask us to consider an aspect of narrative form to which even feminist narratology has paid scant attention: the aspect of embodiment. Classic narratology has defined the basic element of narrative as an event—that is, as a change in a state of affairs <strong> [End Page 218] </strong> (Prince <em>A Dictionary of Narratology</em>). But as Monika Fludernik proposes, narrative might alternatively be defined as <em>experientiality</em>: embodied movement in space and time (12–13). Through this lens, we could argue that the movements of trans bodies, even the trans-ing of trans bodies, constitute textual events. We might then want to ask whether and how the text structures the relationship between body and gender: through what (if any) textual means—for example, description, metaphor, action, speech—are trans bodies represented? From which perspectives or visual angles are they seen? In what settings are characters embodied or not embodied? What aspects of bodies are and are not textually inscribed? In a previous essay written through what I now recognize as a cisgendered lens (<a name="b14-text" href="#b14" class="rid-text">Lanser “Till Death Do Us Part”</a>), I called upon narratology to add the important dimension of corporeality to our “toolkit” by asking “who is embodied, and how?” in addition to classic questions about “who speaks” and “who sees” (122, 128). Such questions are particularly urgent for a narratology that would address the complex interrelationship between embodiment and trans identity. In <em>Continental Divide</em>, the body is recalcitrant, can be tamed, but is vulnerable to violence; in <em>Thirty Names of Night</em>, the bleeding body must be healed to seal the new gender; in <em>Confessions of the Fox</em>, the body must be forcibly altered to become masculine; and <em>Frankissstein</em> abounds not only with represented bodies but with futuristic robots made of pilfered body parts. Mappings of these very differently corporeal novels could provide fascinating insights into the forms of embodiment in trans fiction and perhaps also to trans imaginaries and speculative futures.</p>
<p>One reason why narratology has paid so little attention to embodiment is that narrative theory has focused so heavily on a single genre, the novel, to the neglect of other genres and media. As Dan Punday has noted, both the novel and novel criticism privilege interiority over physical representation (3). It would be more difficult to study film without attending to the positioning and representation of bodies. On the other hand, because it is composed only of words, the novel also allows a potentially useful <em>concealment</em> of embodiment as well as a selective attention to particular bodies and body parts. I would therefore propose that the potential of written narrative, and especially of I-narrative, for a queer and deliberate <em>resistance</em> to embodiment is also important for theorizing trans narrative.</p>
<p>Heterodiegetic (or third-person) narration enables yet another form of complexity for trans narratives: the possibility of a kind of dual identity within a single individual. Alex Myers’s <em>Revolutionary</em>, a historical novel about Deborah Samson, who lived as Robert Shurtliff while serving in the American revolutionary army, tracks the complex intersections of the protagonist’s two identities through the variable use of their two proper names: sometimes one name is absent for a long span of text; sometimes the two names coexist within a paragraph. One of the most compelling moments in the novel is a scene of sexual intimacy between Robert and another soldier, James, after James discovers Robert’s female genitalia. We might then expect the love scene between these two characters to be represented as a scene between James and Deborah, all the more as Deborah/Robert has just revealed their bodily sex. Instead, the scene is narrated entirely as a scene between James and <em>Robert</em>: a scene of queer lovemaking in which “James guided himself into” Robert and “the two of them” moved “together, until Robert couldn’t tell where his flesh stopped and James’s began” <strong> [End Page 219] </strong> (238). What might seem like a scene of cis-gendered heterosexual intercourse on the level of story becomes, on the level of discourse, a representation of sex between men.</p>
<p>It is worth considering, then, whether <em>Revolutionary</em>’s Robert/Deborah might also be seen, on the level of discourse, as two characters. Such an effect might result not only from acts of dual naming, but also from textual juxtapositions between a character’s transgendered present and a cis-gendered past. In his book <em>The One vs. the Many: Minor Characters and the Space of the Protagonist in the Novel</em>, Alex Woloch argues that in any novel, characters both major and minor “jostle” for the limited textual space that any novel affords. With regard to <em>Revolutionary</em>, we could ask how much space—and what kind of space—is taken up by Robert and how much by Deborah, and whether that allocation changes over time. For starters, we would find that Deborah does not become Robert instantly; after Samson first enlists as a male soldier, the text moves back and forth between Deborah’s uncertainties and Robert’s new understandings about how to be a man. He remains Robert through wartime, but when circumstances are more favorable to Deborah’s future—not least because he loves James—Robert remakes himself as queer: “He had been Deborah. He was Deborah still, some part of him. And yet he was Robert—how could he be both? How could he not be? It made no sense, and yet it felt right” (249–50). The novel continues to mix pronouns and identities, in gender-bending phrases such as “three-year men like Deborah” (273). Overwhelmingly, the novel devotes its space to Robert/he rather than to Deborah/she; the novel uses Robert’s name twice as often as it uses Deborah’s, and “Shurtliff ” three times as often as “Samson.” The narrative relinquishes Robert Shurtliff only at the novel’s end, after the protagonist’s assigned gender is revealed and they are living as a cis-gendered a wife and mother. Because the protagonist of <em>Revolutionary</em> was a historical person, Myers’s revisionist novel offers a significant corrective to the scholarship on Samson/Shurtliff, which overwhelmingly refers to them only with female referents.</p>
<p>We might ask similar questions about naming in relation to the “Megan/Morgan” chapter of Bernardine Evaristo’s <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em>. The only trans-focused chapter in this sprawling multi-peopled novel devotes more space to “Megan/she” (21 pages) than to “Morgan/they” (12 pages); it is Megan’s search to <em>become</em> Morgan that the novel inscribes, and once “Morgan (no longer Megan)” (328) emerges after a textual ellipsis of six years, they emerge as an adult who helps younger people become, in the novel’s possibly troubling nomenclature, <em>others</em>.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text">4</a></sup> Character names and character spaces also preoccupy <em>The Thirty Names of Night</em>, which marks the narrator’s transition through chapter titles and acts of naming. The younger character-in-transition is a she without a name, until she tells her older sister that “I’m not a woman.” “I’m pretty sure I’m a boy” (211–12). From then on, the chapters in which that voice speaks are headed by the narrator’s new name, Nadir, which carries very different meanings in English and Arabic. In other novels, by contrast, trans characters insist on their unitary identity: Alex (of <em>The Lauras</em>) is always only Alex; <em>Frankissstein</em>’s Ry Shelley is a self-declared hybrid; Rosenberg’s Jack Sheppard is always Jack on the level of narration even when the character still carries the name P—.</p>
<p>Questions of naming and characterization also, of course, lead to questions of plotting. I identify at least five dominant plot formations in the trans novels I have read, sometimes occurring in combination with one another: (1) plots of trans-becoming: <strong> [End Page 220] </strong> discovering, acknowledging, inhabiting or coming to terms with a trans or nonbinary identity; (2) plots of concealment or passing in which discovery poses risk; (3) plots of disclosure in which a difference between assigned and actual gender is revealed, whether willingly, by happenstance, or by violence; (4) romance plots that emphasize the search for a partner; and what we might call (5) plots in which a trans character happens to be trans, but the plot is about something else, even if inflected by the character’s trans identity. This last is pretty much the case for the professor whose story comes through the footnotes in <em>Confessions of the Fox</em>: his problems concern his university, his manuscript, and his love life but not his gender identity, which is already known to himself and others. It is worth speculating that each of these different plot structures also evokes different temporalities. Do novels of transformation, passing, and revelation reside within a kind of double temporality in which the past shadows the present as an implicit (or explicit) flashback? Or is there a kind of new start in which the character sheds their history?</p>
<p>I’m struck by another form of plotting or subplotting that we find in several of these works: the search for a queer past. <em>Revolutionary</em> is of course a historically based fiction on its own. <em>Frankissstein</em> not only juxtaposes past and futuristic present but turns Mary Shelley into the trans Ry Shelley while also giving us a historical semblance of Shelley herself. As G. M. Mozer explores in fuller detail elsewhere in this issue of <em>Narrative, Confessions of the Fox</em> gender-queers Jack Sheppard, who was actually the most notorious and celebrated English thief of the eighteenth century, and then neatly juxtaposes a modern trans plot in ways that invite us to read the present in terms of both continuity and rupture with the past. <em>Thirty Names of Night</em> alternates Nadir’s story with chapters from the notebook of their grandmother’s beloved and long-lost friend Leila who finally moves from the past into the present. And Alex’s mother’s search for her own past is interlaced with Alex’s coming-of-age story and ultimately reveals another queerer self. In this way, all of these novels operate on some form of dual historicity.</p>
<p>We might also think about the sense of an ending—and ask whether there are particular patterns of resolution within each of the five plot formations that I identified above. It seems striking to me that most of the trans novels I have been discussing end on a tentatively upbeat note. <em>The Lauras</em>’s Alex is finally “on my own. . . . I didn’t know where I was going, and I didn’t have to know. . . . The road was beckoning: all I had to do . . . was follow” (292). <em>Continental Divide’</em>s Ron is accepted as trans, gets the girl he loves, and now senses “that anything could happen—and instead of being scared of that possibility, I was excited” (281). <em>The Thirty Names of Night</em> closes with queer unions and reunions and with the horizon literally in view. <em>Confessions of the Fox</em>, which begins with Jack heading to the gallows, spares him the noose and gives us a surprise escape ending, while his modern trans editor Dr. Voth escapes as well, and to a place that his deserving readers, “the ones I edited this for” (316), won’t need a map to find. For most of these novels, indeed, the future is particularly indeterminate in <em>place</em>, another phenomenon worth further scrutiny. It would be well worth asking whether trans novels in general tend toward positive resolutions and, if so, whether a certain indeterminacy of place helps to enable a kind of literally utopian tendency.</p>
<p>I have focused here on a restricted set of narrative elements: narrator and narratee, embodiment, character space, plotting, closure and to a minor extent, temporality—the <strong> [End Page 221] </strong> one category that arguably demands the fullest narratological exploration insofar as “trans” is definitionally the marker of a temporal phenomenon. Many other narratological concepts and frameworks might illuminate trans narratives. For example, we might look at possible worlds theory as developed by Thomas Pavel (in <em>Fictional Worlds</em>) and Marie-Laure Ryan (in <em>Possible Worlds</em>), especially at the ways in which different worlds are imagined by different characters, how those worlds converge or collide, and whether any of them gets realized in the primary world that the text sets up. Or we might evoke Bakhtin and ask what chronotopes are operating in particular ways for trans characters. What happens when trans narratives are set on the road, that proverbial place of both generative and dangerous chance encounters? What happens in spaces of social conformity such as the drawing room or its modern counterparts? What is revealed only in the privacy of the chamber? Or we might take a dominant plot type such as the Bildungsroman or the marriage plot and ask how trans narratives work within and against them. And since memoir is probably <em>the</em> major genre of trans narrative today, we might want to compare autobiographies and novels to see where their strategies correspond or diverge. Any of these inquiries potentially offers new ways of seeing not only for trans narratology but for narratology <em>tout court</em>. Moreover, I am reminded of Virginia Woolf ’s observation in <em>A Room of One’s Own</em> that each of us has “a spot the size of a shilling at the back of the head which one can never see for oneself ” (94): what are the metaphorical spots that a cisgendered narratology has never noticed and that trans perspectives can place before our collective eyes?</p>
<p>I would add one final wish for a trans narratology: that it invest in exploring narrative practices over time, both for their historical differences and for what G. M. Mozer, writing in this issue, calls a “trans touch across time” (194). As a field of inquiry, narratology has tended to be heavily synchronic, but the investment of so many of my randomly chosen novels in exploring and representing a trans past suggests the value of looking historically at trans narratives and their changing forms. What Monika Fludernik has called a diachronic narratology, more recently reframed by Dorothea Birke, Eva von Contzen, and Karin Kukkonen as “chrononarratology,” would chart the different ways in which trans characters are embodied and represented over time and the characteristics of the story worlds that embed them. We might return to eighteenth-century narratives of cross-dressing to identify textual markers that distinguish circumstantial passing from trans identity, and thereby make different sense of the textual history of sexuality. We might ask what it means that Virginia Woolf ’s <em>Orlando</em>, whose eponymous character undergoes a magical gender transformation, is the only one among Woolf ’s novels to be structured as fantasy. We might look differentially at lesbian and trans readings of <em>The Well of Loneliness</em>. We might ask how it is that Ovid’s metamorphic character Iphis can get a sex change and become a husband while the thirteenth century Silence must become a wife.</p>
<p>I return in closing to the story of Silence with which I began. The <em>Roman de Silence</em> does require the character Silentius to become Silentia, wife of the king, even though it takes Nature three days to remove all trace of manhood from their body. In his dazzlingly creative modern rendering <em>The Story of Silence</em>, however, Alex Myers has it both ways by offering two different endings. In the novel’s final chapters, the masculine pronouns through which Silence has been represented are displaced by <strong> [End Page 222] </strong> an unheralded shift to the nonbinary “they.” Although the last chapter does marry Silence to the king, as a <em>she</em>, in doing so it implies a new and sad meaning to Silence’s name: it no longer signifies the name of a long-kept secret, but stands for feminine submission. In the penultimate chapter preceding that ending, however, the novel imagines a different outcome: Silence, marked still as “they,” simply refuses to be queen. “I cannot be one half of what I am meant to be,” Silence tells the king, “I must be both” (443). The baffled king objects that if Silence refuses his offer of marriage, along with the promised lands and wealth, “you would be no one.” But Silence answers: “I would be myself ” (443). Surely in this phrase we have the underlying motif of trans narrative as of trans life. My wish is for a narratology that can show the rich and varied capacities of narrative practices through which texts can make this happen.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a class="rid_link" name="f1" href="#f1-text">1.</a> My own work has been similarly slow to take on the transformation proposed by “trans.” In 2014 I published a monograph titled <a name="b13-text" href="#b13" class="rid-text"><em>The Sexuality of History: Modernity and the Sapphic 1565–1830</em>,</a> which explores the agency of female same-sex relations in revealing, even shaping, historical consciousness.

The period’s many reinscriptions of Ovid’s Iphis and Ianthe are a case in point.
