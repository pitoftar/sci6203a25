<p>This essay argues that the <em>Roman de Silence</em>'s miniatures perform the text's discourse on the obscurity of visual representation. Disrupting the text's all-too-easy assertions of binary gender, the illuminations trans and transform the manuscript. The illuminator found in the transmasculine Silence's gender performance a model for their own artistry. (CTR)</p>

<p>The <em>Roman de Silence</em> has attracted critical attention for its surprising consideration of gender as a social construct. The poem tells the story of a girl raised as a boy, a situation that leads to a considerable identity crisis in the protagonist, as well as to numerous debates between personifications of <em>Nature</em> [Nature] and <em>Nouriture</em> [Nurture]. But despite Silence's preference for being a knight and their fairly consistent adoption of masculine pronouns, Nature wins out over Nurture and the poem, as Simon Gaunt puts it, firmly rejects possibilities of not only gender as a cultural construct but also of indeterminacy—indeterminate gender and meaning—ultimately reinstating the misogynistic status quo and simple, binary definitions of the 'natural order.'<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1" class="rid-fn-text">1</a></sup> In other words, the poem concludes that social hierarchies are 'natural' hierarchies, and if <em>Silence</em> revels in linguistic play, much beloved by the postmodern critic, it must be remembered that puns like <em>nature</em> [essence] and <em>nature</em> [genital] finally resolve, when Silence's false clothes are stripped off before King Ebain and his court, and their truth or essence is equated to their genitals.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2" class="rid-fn-text">2</a></sup><strong> [End Page 13] </strong></p>
<p>As such, Silence's transmasculinity<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3" class="rid-fn-text">3</a></sup> is repeatedly discussed and ultimately dismissed as a <em>couverture</em> or false cover (esp. ll. 6489–90).<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4" class="rid-fn-text">4</a></sup> The term <em>couverture</em> relates both to the fact that masculine clothing is an essential component of Silence's masculinity and the romance's fixation on the deceptions of representation, including its own poesis. As R. Howard Bloch has demonstrated, the <em>Roman de Silence</em> contains an intriguing discourse on representational systems in which the relation of image to meaning is that of clothing to body.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5" class="rid-fn-text">5</a></sup> Bloch evokes medieval theories of allegory, derived from the late-antique philosopher Macrobius, who compares allegory first to a veil that might be lifted and second to an ambiguous dream-image that might be interpreted, in order to suggest that Silence's outward appearance is merely a <em>bel semblant</em> (l. 5001), under which lies their <em>nature</em>, truth, or essence. While Bloch productively relates this discourse of false images to <em>Silence</em>'s well-studied verbal play and penchant for polysemy, it is worth observing that, on the one hand, in the late Middle Ages, ambiguously gendered bodies were described in related terms, as Leah DeVun has shown.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6" class="rid-fn-text">6</a></sup> Physicians characterized the surface of nonbinary bodies as false covers, under which lied a 'natural' binary gender presentation that surgery could uncover.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in late-medieval France, artworks could also be characterized as artifices, masking the truth and <em>nature</em>. For instance, the vernacular glossed <em>Bible du XIIIe siècle</em> cites Eve's creation of garments or <em>braies</em> [underwear] out of leaves as the invention of the arts. Crafty craft only became necessary as a cover for the genitals after the birth of desire during the Fall. The <em>Bible</em> glosses these <em>braies</em> as 'the covers [<em>couvertures</em>] of lies by which sinners want to defend themselves.'<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7" class="rid-fn-text">7</a></sup> Other texts attribute the invention of the arts to Noah's sons, who similarly cover Noah's genitals with the <em>primes</em><strong> [End Page 14] </strong> <em>braies</em> [first underwear].<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8" class="rid-fn-text">8</a></sup> Such stories participate in a longer medieval tradition that coordinates the mechanical arts with work of the body,<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9" class="rid-fn-text">9</a></sup> and even with perversity,<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10" class="rid-fn-text">10</a></sup> as well as a unique medieval tendency to align metamorphoses with false skins and false images.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11" class="rid-fn-text">11</a></sup> The important fourth-century theologian Saint Augustine will, for instance, explicitly oppose metamorphosis to <em>natura</em> or 'essence,' describing transformations as genuinely experienced but fundamentally imaginary and artificial illusions.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12" class="rid-fn-text">12</a></sup> In this intellectual tradition, churchmen could sometimes refer to sodomites and transvestites themselves as <em>imaginationes</em> or idols, implicitly characterizing non-heteronormative sexualities and queer gender expressions as not only superficial and unreal (common topoi heard to this day) but also somehow pictorial, artistic even.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13" class="rid-fn-text">13</a></sup> Transformation, in <em>Silence</em> and elsewhere, is always a matter of surface, artifice, and misprision—of <em>couverture</em>.</p>
<p>The importance of <em>couverture</em> to the <em>Roman de Silence</em> bears discussion in the context of its survival in a single illuminated manuscript now housed in the University of Nottingham Library (MS WLC/LM/6). <em>Silence</em>'s poet, who calls himself Heldris of Cornwall, and his characters worry about the obscurity of representation and its tendency to mediate and transform their communication, muddying the straight sense of things.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14" class="rid-fn-text">14</a></sup> How fascinating,<strong> [End Page 15] </strong> then, that <em>Silence</em>'s fourteen framed pictures or 'miniatures' are not original to the manuscript and literally cover over some of its inscribed letters [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>].<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15" class="rid-fn-text">15</a></sup> More significantly, close reading of these miniatures demonstrates how challenging they are to interpret in relation to the text. As illustrations, they are profound failures; as interventions and obscurations, allegories for the text's own sense of unnatural gender as a false cover or veil, they are a resounding success. Building on the careful research of Michelle Bolduc and others, I will show over the course of this short essay in two parts how the miniatures transform the narrative and perform the text's discourse on the deceptions and obscurities of visual representation. If the text concludes with simple, binary gender, the illuminated manuscript that stages this text complicates that conclusion, talking back in pictorial <em>silence</em>. By transing <em>Silence</em> in <em>Silence</em>'s own terms, I hold that these miniatures as <em>couvertures</em> represent significant points of metapictorial reflection and learned interventions in the manuscript matrix.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16" class="rid-fn-text">16</a></sup></p>

<p>I want to give the manuscript itself space to define what 'trans' means in medieval terms. A working definition of trans is useful, however. In this essay, my starting point for understanding the <em>Silence</em> manuscript as a trans<strong> [End Page 16] </strong> artwork has relied on contemporary trans theorists, including Maeve Doyle, Kris N. Racaniello, and especially Cáel M. Keegan.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17" class="rid-fn-text">17</a></sup> When I say that the manuscript's illuminations trans <em>Silence</em>, I mean that they transform the text by introducing a new, extralinguistic system of meaning into the textual system: the miniatures. These pictures necessarily transform the text and create ambiguities between word and image.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18" class="rid-fn-text">18</a></sup> As we will see, these ambiguities include ambiguities of gender and sexuality because the miniatures offer distinct ways of seeing <em>Silence</em>'s characters and, I hold, trouble the text's own insistence on binary 'natural' gender. The manuscript is trans in the terms of contemporary trans theorists, then, because it creates space for readers to imagine bodies otherwise in new aesthetic configurations. The artist's agency to enact transformations on the manuscript, transformations that ultimately tell a more nuanced and complex story about gender, also reminds me of the agency necessary for trans people to manipulate their own bodies into new forms and to pursue modes of being that are authentically and visibly their own.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19" class="rid-fn-text">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>Silence</em> manuscript is a multi-text codex, dated to the first half of the thirteenth century. My description here relies on Henry Ravenhall's recent invaluable examination and reassessment of the manuscript. The manuscript contains French verse narratives from the twelfth century. 351 folios (297 mm by 197 mm; justification: 209 mm by 135 mm) are inscribed with two column textblocks of usually forty-six to forty-eight lines, copied by at least three distinct hands.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20" class="rid-fn-text">20</a></sup> There are eighty-three illuminations in total, most recently described by Alison Stones. Per Stones, these pictures were made 'in the form of small framed miniatures in half a text column, of which 68 illustrate the characters and the actions in the various narratives and 15 are<strong> [End Page 17] </strong> decorative panels containing hybrid motifs or birds.'<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21" class="rid-fn-text">21</a></sup> The artist deployed a striking palette of orange and green, which might localize their workshop to the border of Artois and Flanders.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22" class="rid-fn-text">22</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Silence</em> occupies fols. 188r–223r in the manuscript and includes fourteen miniatures, all likely produced by one artist.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23" class="rid-fn-text">23</a></sup> These miniatures remain legible but challenging to interpret, in part, because the majority have been rubbed and significantly damaged by medieval readers. Eleven of the images adhere to Stones' first image-type: simple narrative pictures that reproduce important moments in the text in visual terms. The remaining three represent creature portraits of a lion, a dragon,<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24" class="rid-fn-text">24</a></sup> and a bird. In categorizing the illuminations in this manner, Stones follows <em>Silence</em>'s first editor, Lewis Thorpe, who grouped them in precisely the same way: 'narrative' illustrations and purely 'decorative' creature portraits.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25" class="rid-fn-text">25</a></sup> The 'decorative' images, clustered together towards the end of <em>Silence</em>, suggest to Stones that textual subjects had not been planned for illustration in advance of the artist's execution of the illuminations.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26" class="rid-fn-text">26</a></sup> This observation opens the door to considering the artist's agency when executing <em>Silence</em>'s miniatures. None of the fourteen miniatures function as simple illustrations and instead relate to the poem's metapictorial discourse, suggesting that the artist not only read but also transformed <em>Silence</em> through their artistry.</p>
<p>Michelle Bolduc, the most prolific commentator on <em>Silence</em>'s miniatures, insightfully emphasizes their polysemy and their attention to conversations between characters. Nonetheless, Bolduc essentially agrees with Thorpe's premise, repeated by Stones, that the majority of <em>Silence</em>'s images are in 'direct rapport' with the written text and 'accompany' the dialogues they visualize.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27" class="rid-fn-text">27</a></sup><strong> [End Page 18] </strong> Yet matters are not so simple, and we must bear in mind that speech acts in <em>Silence</em> are occasions for miscommunication and misprision more often than they are moments of clarity. For part one of this essay, let's take the example of one picture that is far and away the manuscript's most frequently reproduced miniature, namely, the image on fol. 203r [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>].<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28" class="rid-fn-text">28</a></sup> I will seek in my analysis to make this apparently simple 'illustration' strange again.</p>
<p>Thorpe identified this miniature as the young Silence with the two traveling musicians. We might accept this reading on the basis of its textual insertion point. The episode in which Silence runs away from home and learns the arts of music with jongleurs surrounds the miniature. But the righthand figure looks unambiguously feminine according to medieval artistic conventions: her long flowing gown is belted at the waist and covers her feet. Her hair is also rather long, tumbling down her shoulders. The poem's musicians are both men. If we accept the left-hand figure as masculine, we might reread this image as an allegory for Silence's inner conflict between masculine and feminine identity, an ingenious reading proposed by F. Regina Psaki.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29" class="rid-fn-text">29</a></sup> This section of the poem is, indeed, ruled by Silence's inner conflict—but neither a personification of masculinity nor femininity is summoned by the text. It is tempting, therefore, to understand the image as a debate between Nature and Nurture, characters who do appear in the text. Unfortunately, they do not appear at this point in the text; their closest appearance is about 500 lines away from the insertion point. Besides, the artist would presumably draw both of these personifications as female, as <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nouriture</em> are feminine nouns, whereas the lefthand figure's shorter hair, red cheeks, and broad and boxy clothing, suggest masculinity. One simpler solution for reading this image, supplied to me by my students, is to understand it as Silence with their parents, Cador and Euphemie.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30" class="rid-fn-text">30</a></sup> Accepting this simple solution requires reading the image as rather out of joint with the text, however, for at this narrative moment Silence has run away from their parents with the musicians, potentially rendering the image an inversion of the text. If we understand this image as an illustration, every potential reading of it (and<strong> [End Page 19] </strong> there are many) necessitates ignoring a problem. Discontinuities haunt any simple relationship between word and image.</p>

<p>One could push the ambiguities of this image still further. According to Thorpe and Bolduc, the miniature on fol. 199r depicts Euphemie and the nurse, who cradles the infant Silence [<a name="fig02-text" href="#fig02">fig. 2</a>]. But are these figures feminine? Their feet are covered by flowing garments, which usually encodes femininity. Yet the raised hand of the right-hand figure designates speech, which in context suggests that we are probably seeing Cador, who directs Euphemie and a nurse how to obscure the baby's <em>nature</em> (l. 2091) and who subsequently commands a priest to baptize them (l. 2120). The miniature's insertion point recommends these scenarios (l. 2127), and long garments notwithstanding, short hair and rosy cheeks imply the righthand figure's masculinity. This identification poses problems for our reading of fol. 203r, however [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>]. If we see Cador directing the nurse or Euphemie on fol. 199r [<a name="fig02-text" href="#fig02">fig. 2</a>], we must acknowledge that this figure shares close physiognomy, pose, and compositional placement with the corresponding figure on fol. 203r. Thorpe reasonably proposes that the artist repeated clothing, colors, and poses across the manuscript to ease identification of the characters, but in this case the figure who at first appeared masculine can be read as feminine, and we might see Silence with two women after all. If alternatively, we see Cador and the priest, in holy vestments, we must remember <em>Silence</em>'s own lessons: clothes, including religious attire, are no guarantor of <em>nature</em> (l. 6548). Gender ambiguities like these riddle the entire program of <em>Silence</em>'s illuminations. Briefly turning to further pictures will further our investigation of fol. 203r.<strong> [End Page 20] </strong></p>

<p>Thorpe and Bolduc identify the miniature on fol. 209r as Silence and the wicked Queen Eufeme (a name easily confused with that of Silence's mother, Euphemie) [<a name="fig03-text" href="#fig03">fig. 3</a>]. The insertion point (l. 4027) certainly suggests this, and the crowned figure's raised hand evokes her scolding Silence: 'Now where do you think you're going?' (l. 4045).<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31" class="rid-fn-text">31</a></sup> What's more, the unusual arch that surrounds the figures suggests the queen's bedchamber of 'solid stone' (l. 4040), in which she entraps the youth. That said, the queen's image-type is replicated in the subsequent miniature on fol. 211r [<a name="fig04-text" href="#fig04">fig. 4</a>], but there Thorpe and Bolduc identify the figure as the King of France, receiving the false letter from Silence. We can read this image, alternatively, as the queen tampering with the Chancellor's letter to resolve this difficulty. Either way, the royal figures of both fol. 209r and 211r are far more masculine than the clearly feminine queen on fol. 214v [<a name="fig05-text" href="#fig05">fig. 5</a>], who not only sports longer hair but also a dainty tiara and an effeminate cloak as opposed to a masculine toga. The placement and composition of fol. 209r's miniature endeavor to signal to us that we see a queen—but we may see a king [<a name="fig03-text" href="#fig03">fig. 3</a>].</p>

<p>I must acknowledge here that the gender ambiguity of many of these characters is a partial consequence of damage to the manuscript. We cannot assume that all these ambiguities result from artistic decisions nor that they would have puzzled the manuscript's early readers, who were highly sensitive to the artistic conventions of their own visual culture. It seems likely, given medieval readers' common tendency to destroy images of perversity, that miniatures in this manuscript were damaged in response to the romance's queer premise.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32" class="rid-fn-text">32</a></sup> If readers sought to address problems of gender ambiguity, however, they certainly accentuated them, rendering the manuscript more difficult to interpret and exacerbating gender ambiguities in the miniatures. That said, I have been careful to discuss aspects of the images that we can see, rather than what is missing, and point out inconsistencies within the codes of binary gender, on the model of the work of E. Jane Burns and, more recently, Maeve Doyle.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33" class="rid-fn-text">33</a></sup> In all likelihood, fol. 199r depicts two men—with covered feet [<a name="fig02-text" href="#fig02">fig. 2</a>]. In all likelihood, fol. 209r depicts a queen—in a king's clothes [<a name="fig03-text" href="#fig03">fig. 3</a>]! The miniatures break gender conventions, disrupting the dress codes of binary gender, revealing inconsistencies therein and a spectrum of gaps between polarities that our text views as absolutes.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34" class="rid-fn-text">34</a></sup> Indeed, fol. 203r exhibits<strong> [End Page 22] </strong> hardly any damage [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>], and yet no one can agree on what it depicts, let alone the <em>natures</em> of its characters.</p>
<p>Let's return to fol. 203r and pose another question about it, in lieu of a firm conclusion. We might recall that shortly above the miniature's insertion point, Silence dreams of their heart [<em>cuers</em>] accusing them of lying about gender at the level of surface appearance (ll. 2826–72). Might not the image depict this scene of Silence caught between their <em>cuers</em> (a masculine noun that refers to a feminine interior) and their false appearance, their <em>couverture</em> or <em>vesteüre</em> (l. 2329), a feminine noun that refers to masculine clothing? This proposal might seem farfetched to those who assume that images perform as 'illustrations' and manifest direct rapports with texts. Alternatively, I feel tempted to read this image as an allegory for the impossibility of reading any painted image, for illuminations, particularly those without captions as in this manuscript, are ultimately silent. There is a relationship drawn between Silence's body, an ambiguous pictorial representation, and this painted book.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35" class="rid-fn-text">35</a></sup></p>
<p>In the next installment of this essay, I will turn to further images in the <em>Silence</em> manuscript to shore up my argument that by painting pictures into this book—and literally over some of its letters—a medieval artist drew a parallel between making art out of raw materials and transing a body, between painting pictures and covering Silence. I hope I have demonstrated already that apparently simple 'illustrations' are more complicated than they might seem at first, tempting us to interpret them as they summon up a slew of potential meanings, only to foreclose every road they open, until we understand that obscurity is their preferred mode of play. Significantly, their ambiguities implicate gender, and figures besides Silence whom we thought were unambiguously male or female appear more indeterminate than we might read them in an unilluminated manuscript. It is for this reason that I consider the <em>Silence</em> manuscript a trans artwork.</p>
</div>
<div class="sec">
<h2 class="sec-headA"><small class="caps">part ii</small></h2>
<p>I find myself uncomfortably aligned with King Ebain, who strips Silence down in order to discover the truth of their body. In the previous installment of this essay, I examined a picture that has been characterized as a simple illustration of the <em>Roman de Silence</em> text [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>]. I searched for visual evidence of its transness and found a rather obscure image that enacted gender ambiguities<strong> [End Page 23] </strong> on the text that would not exist without it. That investigation was fruitful and concluded with the suggestion that we might read this miniature as an allegory for the obscurity of all visual representation. But in scrutinizing signifiers of biological difference and understanding transness in relation to disguise, I certainly risk succumbing to a transphobic logic that assumes an equivalence of the naked body and gender identity, as well as trans and non-binary identities as unreal fabrications.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36" class="rid-fn-text">36</a></sup> As Alicia Spencer-Hall and Blake Gutt warn powerfully, these are 'pernicious' tropes that, on one the hand, often originate with modern critics rather than medieval texts and, on the other, may inflict real harm to living trans and non-binary people today.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37" class="rid-fn-text">37</a></sup> These are high-stakes interpretative problems.</p>

<p>With them in mind, I turn next to <em>Silence</em>'s creature portraits because there is consensus that these miniatures are not narrative illustrations [<a name="fig06-text" href="#fig06">fig. 6</a>]. According to Michelle Boulduc, they are allegorical, glossing the poem's narrative by referencing illuminated bestiaries.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38" class="rid-fn-text">38</a></sup> These non-literal images will enable us to understand the specific types of allegories and obscurities the<strong> [End Page 24] </strong> medieval illuminator favored, as they transed the manuscript, and I explore them in order to show, first, that the obscurities of <em>Silence</em>'s images perform the medieval text's own discourse on the obscurity of images and, second, that these images point to authentic possibilities of gender beyond any binary—even the very miniature of King Ebain's investigation into Silence's body, with which I conclude. Ultimately, the miniatures resist transphobic logic, and demand that we recognize instances of certain medieval people understanding gender and gender inequalities as constructed and mutable. The conception of a Middle Ages as monolithically transphobic is undermined by a manuscript artist who saw in Silence ideal performances of transgression that could be imitated.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39" class="rid-fn-text">39</a></sup></p>
<p>As a reminder, <em>Silence</em>, like many late-medieval texts refers to visual representations and to trans bodies as <em>couvertures</em>, artificial covers that hide the truth and hide <em>nature</em> (a word that in <em>Silence</em>'s medieval French means both 'essence' and 'genital'). I hold that <em>Silence</em>'s miniatures as <em>couvertures</em> represent significant points of metapictorial reflection that simultaneously disclose unspoken histories of medieval transness and unspoken histories of a medieval artist, who saw in Silence's transition a model and an opportunity to enact a transformation of their own. This essay continues to argue that the <em>Silence</em> manuscript theorizes itself as a trans artwork in medieval terms. I hope that by reframing disguise as artistry and self-fashioning, a pro-trans reclamation of the trope of <em>couverture</em> might occur, one grounded historically in a medieval artist's own reappropriation of that trope. I intentionally frame Silence as trans (rather than, say, transvestite) to resist the continued weaponization of the trope of transness as an unreal identity,<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40" class="rid-fn-text">40</a></sup> while yet embracing and celebrating the power of artistic performance and, indeed, fiction to speak queer truths and embody trans realness.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41" class="rid-fn-text">41</a></sup><strong> [End Page 25] </strong></p>
<p>The first creature on fol. 213r is probably a lion [<a name="fig06-text" href="#fig06">fig. 6</a>]. In Bolduc's reading, the lion, whom the bestiary describes as the merciful king of beasts, glosses the episode in which the King of France weighs granting the wrongly condemned Silence clemency. It is worth remembering too that bestiary texts assert that 'the lion has three natures,' a suggestion with unsettling implications for <em>Silence</em>'s conclusion that each of us has one true <em>nature</em> (our genitals), though we may hide this <em>nature</em> under many false appearances.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42" class="rid-fn-text">42</a></sup> The lion, the occasional sex partner of the hyena,<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43" class="rid-fn-text">43</a></sup> whose <em>nature</em> transforms from male to female according to the bestiary,<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44" class="rid-fn-text">44</a></sup> reminds us that the 'natural' world is itself an appearance that can be probed for rich allegorical and moral meanings. Discovering those meanings absolutely proves difficult, however. Indeed, even the noble lion uses its tail, so prominent in the <em>Silence</em> manuscript's depiction, to conceal its tracks [or <em>vestigia</em>], in order to escape hunters. The signs of nature are difficult to interpret and easily obliterated, much like these miniatures. Ironically, in the case of this picture, it is the lion's tail that a reader erased.</p>
<p>R. Howard Bloch has helpfully connected <em>Silence</em>'s view of Nature with the aforementioned Macrobius' conception of Nature, who 'envelops herself in variegated garments' such that her truths are not disclosed.'<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45" class="rid-fn-text">45</a></sup> The evocation of the natural world and the bestiary render the illuminated program of <em>Silence</em> rather bookish, inviting a learned reader to probe nature's secrets and lift veils of allegory across the illuminations. But interpretation may fail. For instance, I wondered if the lion's three <em>natures</em>, in the sense of 'principal attributes,' here evoke the King's three advisors who debate Silence's fate and ultimately decide to save them from death, much as the trinitarian lion resurrects its cubs from death.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46" class="rid-fn-text">46</a></sup> But I have had no luck mapping their positions onto the<strong> [End Page 26] </strong> lion's three natures, let alone the allegorical manifestations of these. Peter Allen once suggested that the creature portraits, which include mythic beasts, serve to remind readers that this text belongs 'to the domain of fantasy.'<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47" class="rid-fn-text">47</a></sup> We might say rather that visual representations, including these miniatures, offer sites of misprision—the imaginary, the fantasy—that obscure the truth, as does a lion's tail.</p>
<p>Nature wears variegated garments, and this lion can be read as a dog (Thorpe), a pardus (Bolduc), and I would add a panther. If for <em>Silence</em>'s characters, there can only be male or female, that is two binary <em>natures</em>, the lion's third <em>nature</em> reminds us that every time we think we parse a manuscript image, a complication of gender indeterminacy inevitably arises to disrupt semiotic closure. Is the left-hand figure on fol. 203r masculine or feminine [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>]? Is the figure on fol. 211r a king or a queen [<a name="fig04-text" href="#fig04">fig. 4</a>]? With the creature illuminations in mind [<a name="fig06-text" href="#fig06">fig. 6</a>], might we say that any <em>nature</em> is ultimately a masquerade of false appearances? Might the lion visualize a third non-binary <em>nature</em>, a silent category whose name the <em>Silence</em> text dares not speak? I suggest that the artist, first as a reader, responds to the text's fixation on <em>nature</em> and, second as an imaginative creator, intervenes in the manuscript, inserting this miniature when the lion's merciful nature is thematically relevant to a tripartite debate. Insofar as the lion refers to the text as an illustration, the miniature is an example of an obscure and potentially false image, with no 'explicit link' to the text,<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48" class="rid-fn-text">48</a></sup> like Silence's own unnatural appearance at odds with their interior heart. But it is this very appearance that so enchants the poem's characters.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49" class="rid-fn-text">49</a></sup> We find in these illuminations a clever artist championing their beguiling craft and their playful skill at riddling and artifice.</p>
<p>The poem concludes with an image of Silence's clothing stripped off and their <em>nature</em> revealed (fol. 222v) [<a name="fig07-text" href="#fig07">fig. 7</a>]. Here, we ought to finally discover a simple depiction of <em>nature</em>, and yet the image is quite challenging to read. To begin, this miniature has been greatly damaged, and any unambiguous signs of Silence's sex that may have existed have been rubbed out and lost. What is more, what is visible today is itself surprisingly complex. For instance, Silence's hair remains masculine and cut short in the picture. As a general rule, masculine figures of a similar physiognomy appear on the left side of<strong> [End Page 27] </strong> miniatures in this program (e.g. 195v, 199r (?) [<a name="fig02-text" href="#fig02">fig. 2</a>], 201r, 203r [<a name="fig01-text" href="#fig01">fig. 1</a>], 206v), that is in Silence's position, further suggesting enduring masculinity.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50" class="rid-fn-text">50</a></sup> Finally, it appears that Silence's outer thigh may have obscured their genitals from view, and the hint of their breast that remains visible today appears pectoral-like in aspect.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51" class="rid-fn-text">51</a></sup> We cannot discount the possibility that Silence's <em>nature</em> was never painted in binary terms.</p>

<p>As Bolduc has also written, the ivory skin of Silence evokes a later moment in the text than the miniature purports to visualize [<a name="fig07-text" href="#fig07">fig. 7</a>], when Nature remakes the surface of Silence as feminine, removing its masculine qualities (ll. 6669–76). Silence ought to be darker skinned in this picture.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52" class="rid-fn-text">52</a></sup> The observation is a fruitful one because it draws attention to the pallor of all of the figures in the manuscript across gender lines, rendering one of the poem's primary signifiers of gender difference indeterminate and unreadable (e.g. l. 2827), like empty parchment awaiting inscription or painting by an artist. Indeed, in the program's first miniature on fol. 188r [<a name="fig08-text" href="#fig08">fig. 8</a>], the analogy of empty parchment and the body appears in full view, as a reader's painted hand seems to merge seamlessly with a painting of an unpainted manuscript leaf. Returning to fol. 222v [<a name="fig07-text" href="#fig07">fig. 7</a>], the static, almost petrified appearance of the<strong> [End Page 28] </strong> denuded Silence evokes images of Lot's Wife surprised at her transformation into a statue of salt (an <em>ymage de sel</em>, per the <em>Bible du XIIIe siècle</em>).<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53" class="rid-fn-text">53</a></sup> As I have argued elsewhere, medieval artists sometimes align sodomitical—that is, unnatural—behaviors with artworks and the creation of images, on the basis that the fashioning of trans bodies and the artistic fashioning of images both represent imaginative acts that remake 'natural' materials into new pictorial forms.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54" class="rid-fn-text">54</a></sup> It is intriguing that, at this moment when natural gender and Silence's true essence might be revealed, the artist evokes the unnatural and the imagistic, instead. These images, even when they depict nude bodies, offer covers that obscure the straight sense of this text and trouble the discovery of Silence's <em>nature</em>. As Silence's enduring transness in images comes to resist their ultimate straightening in the poem, the artist's own vision comes into view, at the very moments when their images obscure and transform words intoned by Heldris and set down by scribes.</p>

<p>It is the interventions of the illuminator in this text that I wish to conclude with. They trans the story, rendering even kings, at times, rather ambiguous potential queens. The images, thus, allow far queerer readings of this romance than the text can support on its own. It is worth remembering that these<strong> [End Page 29] </strong> miniatures were not an original component of the manuscript's design scheme: large initials were.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55" class="rid-fn-text">55</a></sup> As I mentioned at the outset of this essay, these pictures literally paint over and obscure the text, such that the first letter of each word following the present illuminations can no longer be read. The miniatures are interventions in the text that transform it—and potentially obscure its narrative and its meanings. The miniatures, as literal covers and interpretive obscurations, thus, evoke the discussions of Silence's gender as a <em>couverture</em> and false image present in the text itself, actualizing the text's discourse on images. The association between miniature and <em>couverture</em> would have been strikingly clear to medieval readers, who would have had to lift textile curtains sewed over the miniatures in order to see them.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56" class="rid-fn-text">56</a></sup> In lifting the veils to see the illuminations, readers would themselves enact processes of <em>couvrir</em> and <em>descovir</em>, described by Heldris and performed by Ebain (l. 6509), only to discover further obscurations in the miniatures themselves. Uncovering a miniature would reveal—not the truth of the text, not an illustration, but—material and pictorial actualizations of the text's discussions of surface appearance and, at certain points, potentials for non-binary embodiments that transcend the text's limitations.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can read the manuscript as a trans artwork in the theoretical terms set out by Cáel M. Keegan, in that the illuminated manuscript makes visible 'normally unseen transfer[s] between' the seemingly 'irreconcilable points' of male and female and offers an 'aesthetic space' that opens a way through what appeared to be a 'closed phenomenological horizon of binary gender.'<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57" class="rid-fn-text">57</a></sup> More importantly, we can also read the manuscript as a trans artwork in the terms set out by the medieval manuscript itself. The manuscript is a site of <em>couvertures</em>. Ultimately, it would seem that an illuminator produced a startlingly reflexive manuscript that theorizes their own paintings as transformations that cover over and trans the text, rendering kings queens and the final discovery of natural sex arrestingly <em>contre nature</em>.</p>
<p>This topic bears discussion today because it is often assumed that queer thinking is a modern imposition on past material. Indeed, the striking nature of <em>Silence</em>'s medieval discourses of gender have been called almost 'anachronistic.'<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58" class="rid-fn-text">58</a></sup> Yet here we find a complete medieval artifact—from word to image—in which artistic creation is analogized to transformation and indeed to transition. When we fail to name this medieval trans thinking, we<strong> [End Page 30] </strong> throw our own <em>couvertures</em> over the reality of the past, a past that was able to articulate queer and trans conceptualizations of art. Although this theory depended on a transphobic coordination of 'unnatural' bodies with artificiality and false images, it is also the very misalignment of (false) miniature to (true) word, that allows the medieval artist to assert a degree of independence.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59" class="rid-fn-text">59</a></sup> It is the deviations from or perversions of the word that allow the artist's interventions in the manuscript to be seen and Silence's indeterminacy to endure through the text's misogynistic and transphobic conclusions—to speak authentically through silence. And if medieval readers attacked these pictures out of sympathy for the text's final disavowal of the hero's transness, touching these queers only served to knock signifiers looser.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60" class="rid-fn-text">60</a></sup> Similarly, in touching these queer, ambiguous representations, readers revealed all the more forcefully what they sought to repress.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61" class="rid-fn-text">61</a></sup> That's a lesson worth learning now, when in my own country, trans youth face a wave of new repressive legislation and latter day Ebains, committed to reigning social hierarchies, 'the binary nature of sex,'<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62" class="rid-fn-text">62</a></sup> and eliminating nurture from considerations of sex.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63" class="rid-fn-text">63</a></sup> In other words, the conservative need to regulate the body accidentally acknowledges the trans potentials of all bodies and the artificial and unnatural qualities of the law, which is imposed on free bodies from without.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64" class="rid-fn-text">64</a></sup><strong> [End Page 31] </strong></p>
<p>Most medievalists agree that manuscript illuminations serve as glosses on their texts.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65" class="rid-fn-text">65</a></sup> We might bear in mind with Bloch that to <em>golozer</em> in <em>Silence</em>'s medieval French meant first 'to desire' and 'to dispute,' and only second 'to gloss.'<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66" class="rid-fn-text">66</a></sup> In these small pictorial acts of transformation of binary gendered texts, I am reminded that contemporary gender performance and certainly drag performance involves imagination, desire, resistance, and yes artificiality, but these elements do not render the performances invalid nor inauthentic.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67" class="rid-fn-text">67</a></sup> To see the manuscript as a kind of trans body is to see a free performance of artistry from within and against the structures that wish to constrain it. Queerness exists and must exist within this manuscript as 'a concrete cultural possibility' that is nonetheless characterized as unreal—by Heldris, medieval readers, and some modern ones too.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68" class="rid-fn-text">68</a></sup> And yet in imitating Silence, a medieval artist gave some testimony to trans embodiment as authentic, powerful, and manifestly exemplary, a model for artists and, perhaps, readers who sought truths beyond the text's all-too-simple conclusion. It may, in fact, be Silence's bold authenticity that recommended them as an artistic inspiration for the illuminator's trans performance, a performance that draws out more nuanced and accurate reflections on gender and ultimately draws out precisely what the text ought to have said.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69" class="rid-fn-text">69</a></sup><strong> [End Page 32] </strong></p>
<p>That may be too bold a conclusion for some of my readers. I wager that even they will concede that all medieval manuscripts manifest and negotiate a constellation of identities—including authors, scribes, and illuminators—resulting in unstable and transitional multimedia gestures.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70" class="rid-fn-text">70</a></sup> Why not call these artful gestures 'trans?' As my favorite drag queen and non-binary performer Sasha Velour might say, it is not under the false lashes, wigs, and makeup where the truth lies; truth and beauty emerge directly out of these material gestures as a special kind of realness and authenticity.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71" class="rid-fn-text">71</a></sup> The queen's lip synch may be silent, but their music moves us nonetheless.</p>

Bychowski, who compellingly shows how medieval trans embodied subjects, including those sometimes called 'transvestites,' strive for authenticity. It is my hope that this essay reappropriates and begins to deconstruct tropes of trans and queer artifice rather than simply repeat them. I empathize with her exhaustion with this trope (which has been wielded against my own work and against me, too). I nonetheless see in fiction and in the imagination potential powers to be reclaimed and wielded in the project of queer liberation. I appreciate, however, that my approach here is a risky one. Please consult Bychowski's scholarship to understand these risks, as well as potential blind spots in my scholarship, written with love and with knowledge of its incompleteness.
